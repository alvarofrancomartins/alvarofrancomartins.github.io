## Foundation: Unicode and Language Data

[Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/) is the global standard that defines how text, numbers, and symbols are represented on computers, ensuring billions of devices and platforms can handle content consistently across hundreds of languages. 

<br>

For this post, I relied on the Unicode Consortium’s [Territory-Language](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/47/supplemental/territory_language_information.html). This dataset captures the percentage of literate, functional populations using each language in each country, providing a sociolinguistic view of global language usage.

## Methodology: Building the Network
Using this dataset, a country–country network was constructed:  

- **Nodes:** Countries with populations of at least 200,000.  
- **Edges:** A link exists if two countries share a language spoken by at least 50% of their population.  
- **Filtering:** Smaller components were removed, focusing on the largest connected component.  

The resulting network includes **89 countries** and **1338 connections**.

## Macro-Structure of the Network
- **Arabic Cluster:** Dense community across North Africa and the Middle East, tied together by Arabic.  
- **Francophone Cluster:** Extends from Europe into Africa and overseas territories, linking France, Luxembourg, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, and Mauritius.  
- **Anglophone Cluster:** The most globally dispersed, spanning Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas.  
- **Broker Nodes:** Countries such as Tunisia, Sudan, UAE and Luxembourg serve as bridges, linking these clusters into one global system.

## Key Bridges and Connectors
- **Tunisia – Connects French and Arabic worlds:** The sole bridge between Arabic and Francophone hubs.
- **Sudan & UAE – Connect Arabic and English worlds:** Sudan and UAE ties the Arabic cluster to the Anglophone.
- **Luxembourg & Mauritius – Connect English and French worlds:** Luxembourg unites Romance and Germanic Europe while projecting outward to Africa; Mauritius strengthens Francophone–Anglophone ties from the Indian Ocean.  
- **Estonia – Connects English and Russian worlds:** Prevents the Russian-speaking bloc from isolation, reflecting its balance between eastern history and western integration.
