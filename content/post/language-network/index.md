## Foundation: Unicode and Language Data
This project builds on the Unicode Consortium’s ecosystem of open standards, which underpins the internationalization of digital systems worldwide. Unicode ensures that billions of devices and platforms can handle text, numbers, and formats across hundreds of languages and scripts.  

<br>

To extend this foundation, I relied on [Territory-Language](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/47/supplemental/territory_language_information.html) data from CLDR and Ethnologue, supplemented by census and World Bank figures. This dataset captures the percentage of literate, functional populations using each language in each country, providing not only technical compatibility but also a sociolinguistic view of global language use.

## Methodology: Building the Network
Using this dataset, a country–country network was constructed:  

- **Nodes:** Countries with populations above 200,000.  
- **Edges:** A link exists if two countries share a language spoken by at least 50% of their population.  
- **Filtering:** Smaller components were removed, focusing on the largest connected component.  

The resulting network includes **89 countries** and **1338 connections**. The most connected nodes were **Sudan (62), UAE (62), Luxembourg (60), Mauritius (59), and Estonia (47).**

## Macro-Structure of the Network
- **Arabic Cluster:** Dense community across North Africa and the Middle East, tied together by Arabic.  
- **Francophone Cluster:** Extends from Europe into Africa and overseas territories, linking France, Luxembourg, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, and Mauritius.  
- **Anglophone Cluster:** The most globally dispersed, spanning Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas.  
- **Broker Nodes:** Countries such as Tunisia, Sudan, and the UAE serve as bridges, linking these clusters into one global system.

## Key Bridges and Connectors
- **Tunisia – Connects French and Arabic worlds:** The sole bridge between Arabic and Francophone blocs, a keystone broker whose removal would fragment the system. Over half of Tunisians are fluent in French alongside Arabic.  
- **Sudan & UAE – Connect Arabic and English worlds:** Sudan ties the Arabic cluster to the Anglophone bloc, while the UAE adds stability and outward corridors.  
- **Luxembourg & Mauritius – Connect English and French worlds:** Luxembourg unites Romance and Germanic Europe while projecting outward to Africa; Mauritius strengthens Francophone–Anglophone ties from the Indian Ocean.  
- **Estonia – Connects English and Russian worlds:** Prevents the Russian-speaking bloc from isolation, reflecting its balance between eastern history and western integration.

## Structural Insights
The network’s cohesion depends on a handful of multilingual brokers. Tunisia is the most critical hinge, Sudan and the UAE keep Arabic–English corridors open, Luxembourg and Mauritius reinforce French–English ties, and Estonia bridges Russian to the Anglophone world. Connectivity here is not about size but about position: **strategic brokers reduce fragmentation, redundant pairs add resilience, and multilingual societies hold the global system together.**
