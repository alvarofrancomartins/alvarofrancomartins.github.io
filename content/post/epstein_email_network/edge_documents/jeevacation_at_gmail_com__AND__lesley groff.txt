Dear Friend, 
Mary Matalin and Hilary Rosen debate torture, Afghan, and Obama after Osama. How is the Barack & Hillary 
"Team of Rivals" performing on foreign policy? And the women clash on Gingrich and Gibson (Mel). 
Here, fyi, is today's HuffingtonPost feature and audio:

Dear Friend, 
Both Sides Now w/Huffington & Matalin celebrates its 1st anniversary this week. As the 
only 2 sides/2 women show on national radio, we've grown from 16 stations in May of 
2010 to 110 now. 
Arianna and Mary find consensus that, contrary to the Washington and media 
conventional wisdom, the Jobs Agenda is more urgent than the Deficit Agenda ("if people 
only read about shark attacks, they'll worry about shark attacks," says Arianna). And they 
agree that there's an apparent outbreak of men abusing the help -- Strauss-Kahn, 
Schwarzenegger, Ensign. To paraphase Freud, what do men want? 
But there's sharp disagreement about whether Rep. Ryan walked into Obama's trap by 
proposing to end Medicare in 10 years. Will the special election this Tuesday in Jack 
Kemp's old seat produce a Democratic "Scott Brown Moment"?

Exceptional Public Schools Cited By 
Obama, Get Critical Backing From 
Investor, Jeffrey Epstein 
PR Newswire 
NEW YORK, July 5, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- A group of unique public high schools in New 
York State and New Jersey, cited by President Obama as role models for the nation, have 
received critical funding from science investor, Jeffrey Epstein and his foundation, The  
Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation. The schools are called the Bard High School Early College  
schools (BHSEC) in Manhattan and Queens of New York City and in Newark, New Jersey. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026567 
The Bard schools are not charter schools. They are financed by New York State and New 
Jersey. However, they run with the efficiency and success of a prominent charter school. 
The schools are small, with less than 600 students each and a student teacher ratio of 20 
to 1. Admission is academically exclusive, focusing on academic records, writing and math 
assessments and an eagerness for ideas and learning. And like most charter schools, the 
BHSEC schools critically have autonomy, even though they have to meet Regent state 
exams and state graduation guidelines. They have the autonomy to run their teaching 
staff, budget, operations and curriculum. 
Unlike charter schools however, BHSEC schools provide an entire high school curriculum 
in just two years and then two years of college level credits. After four years, students 
graduate with sixty college credits, a state Regents high school diploma and a Bard College 
Associate in Arts degree in the liberal arts and sciences. This accelerated approach comes 
from the schools' belief that many young people are ready and eager to do serious college 
work at age sixteen and that young adults' ambition to learn must be taken seriously. 
The results have been exceptional: 95% of BHSEC graduates attend college. In July 2009, 
President Obama, addressing the NAACP's centennial convention cited the schools as a 
role model for the nation: "Innovations like Bard High School Early College and Medgar 
Evers College Preparatory School that are challenging students to complete high school 
and earn a free associate's degree or college credit in just four years." In 2012, The New 
York Observer ranked BHSEC as the #1 public high school in New York City, with an A+ 
grade, outranking the top private school. 
BHSEC has its roots in the college system. In June 2001, The New York City Board of 
Education and Bard College created Bard High School Early College with the support of 
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Since the 1960's Bard College, originally called, 
Bard College of Simon's Rock, was the nation's only four year college and was designed for 
younger scholars. 
"Competition is tough," Jeffrey Epstein notes, whose foundation actively supports public 
education across the country. "Approximately 7,000 applicants compete for 150 seats each 
fall. So we need to continue working with state education boards to duplicate this 
successful model."

Dear Jeffrey-
We are thrilled to announce that we are working with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, one of the rising stars in 
the New York Congressional delegation. Sometimes referred to as "Brooklyn's Barack", he is a staunch 
supporter of President Obama and a progressive voice for the people of New York City. NY1 did a profile piece 
about his work on the vitally important Budget and Judiciary committees in Washington. You can watch the  
video here  or read the text below. 
Hakeem is committed to electing a Democratic majority in 2014 and is encouraging his friends to participate in 
the DCCC/DSCC fundraising dinner with President Obama this coming Monday night. Shoot us an email or 
give us a call at (212) 531-2858 if you would like to get involved with the dinner, or would like to get an 
opportunity to get to know Hakeem better. He is an impressive guy and who will be a progressive voice in New 
York politics for years to come. 
Thanks, 
Darren Rigger, Lisa Rossi & Walter Swett

NY!: Hakeem Jeffries Positions Himself For Long Career In Washington 
Apr 29, 2013 
By: Michael Scotto 
Hakeem Jeffries is only about four months into his freshman year in Congress but he's already positioning 
himself for a long career in Washington. NY 1 's Michael Scotto filed the following report. 
If you're looking to knock Hakeem Jeffries off message, you won't get very far. 
"There's a hip hop song, every day I'm hustling, and I kind of feel that way down here in Washington," Jeffries 
said. "In a positive manner, of course." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029342 
The freshman congressman from Brooklyn and a sliver of Queens is an ambitious work horse who always 
appears to have his eye on the prize. 
"I'll be shuffling back and forth between budget and judiciary for the better part of the morning, making sure we 
time it correctly so that I'm able to ask questions in both situations," he said. 
He's a big change from Congressman Ed Towns, who retired after holding the seat for 30 years. 
On any given day, Jeffries is traveling through the Capitol, attending hearings on the Judiciary and Budget 
committees, two of the most prominent in the lower chamber. 
For Jeffries, those two assignments allow him to serve as a counterweight to the Republican leadership and to 
talk up the President, whom he and his district overwhelmingly support. 
"My job, I believe, is to help the administration of Barack Obama help us back at home," Jeffries said. 
In his first four months, Jeffries has championed himself as a progressive, introducing legislation to help student 
loan recipients and voting against a bill Friday to ease the impact of automatic spending cuts to the FAA 
because it didn't stop cuts to programs that are impacting the poor. 
In the months and years ahead, Jeffries says there's plenty to do. 
"There's no shortage of the people's business down in Washington, D.C. and that's why the job is one that is a 
serious endeavor," he said. 
A serious endeavor that is also very much on message.

Dear Jeffrey, 
May I drop by before the New Year (perhaps on the 9th, or on the 17th or 18th?) to get your advice 
about my renewal of the Templeton campaign, and also my needs in the coming year for Poetry in 
America? Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the bottom a 
message just for you.... 
-Lisa 
That you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose 
support— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to 
realize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to 
produce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of 
humanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and informal, 
online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to 
begin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work. 
Whether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker's Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal 
sponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an 
elusive friend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or 
provided overnight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you 
highlighted our work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors; 
whether you flew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or asked 
your children's school to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation to take an 
interest in the project, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of finance, or of 
distribution; whether you praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you enabled what we 
have done. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029242 
Here's what we have to report, and to show, a year later, thanks to your help. Links offer sneak 
peeks of works -in-progress across the full portfolio of Poetry in America projects. 
• The first eight-episode season of the public television series Poetry in America (a co-
production between WGBH, Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Grubin, and my own new 
production company, Verse Video), is now fully funded and in production, with episodes featuring  
Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock and Sonia Sanchez on Langston Hughes, Frank Gehry on Carl 
Sandburg, Katie Couric on Elizabeth Bishop, Nas on Whitman, and many more scheduled for 
nationwide launch in 2017. 
• Poetry in America's many initiatives to reach Middle and High School teachers and their 
students are taking root. Our first online course for Middle and High School Teachers, Poetry of 
the City, will launch this Spring with the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Companion 
materials to this course will be made available for free on PBS LearningMedia. This course is 
designed to meet the needs of English Language Arts and Social Studies teachers in the US and 
internationally. 
• We are eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for 
Middle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language 
Arts instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural  
world, conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the 
field with great teachers. 
• A recent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network 
of charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready 
educational material on The Poetry of Art Sport, and Play. This collection will include discussions 
on poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature dancers, 
athletes, fashion designers, and more. 
• With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems, 
we are eager to expand our reach and move into America's schools, disseminating, testing, 
and learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work 
evaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to 
produce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth. 
Working closely with such partners as The Nantucket Project, Nautilus Magazine, The Aspen Ideas 
Festival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard's provider of free open online 
courses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and 
lifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky's  
"Shirt" (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part 
Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries. 
Growing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a 
fundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We've taken 
a big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our 
website— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and 
educational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch! 
Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The 
Leon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff I desperately needed to 
complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set 
down a solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029243 
humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they 
heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts 
and Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video 
production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in 
producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard students. 
My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our collection 
for PBS LeamingMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the most 
consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year that 
make future projects that much more likely. If I can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling these 
coffers, I will be that much more able to keep working. 
I am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help 
you have offered to give in bringing them around. I have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten 
funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test, 
that video in schools as I proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where I 
could also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their 
character criteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe 
Biden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the 
platform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building 
literacy and character in the schools. 
It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking 
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it's always annoying but I always learn. 
With abundant gratitude, 
Lisa

Dear Jeffrey, 
May I drop by before the New Year (perhaps on the 9th, or on the 17th or 18th?) to get your 
advice about my renewal of the Templeton campaign, and also my needs in the coming year for 
Poetry in America? Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the 
bottom a message just for you.... 
-Lisa 
That you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose 
support— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to 
realize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to 
produce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of 
humanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and 
informal, online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to 
begin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028950 
Whether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker's Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal 
sponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an 
elusive friend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or 
provided overnight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you 
highlighted our work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors; 
whether you flew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or asked 
your children's school to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation to take 
an interest in the project, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of finance, or of 
distribution; whether you praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you enabled what we 
have done. 
Here's what we have to report, and to show, a year later, thanks to your help. Links offer sneak 
peeks of works -in-progress across the full portfolio of Poetry in America projects. 
• The first eight-episode season of the public television series Poetry in America (a co-
production between WGBH, Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Grubin, and my own new 
production company, Verse Video), is now fully funded and in production, with episodes featuring  
Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock and Sonia Sanchez on Langston Hughes, Frank Gehry on Carl 
Sandburg, Katie Couric on Elizabeth Bishop, Nas on Whitman, and many more scheduled for 
nationwide launch in 2017. 
• Poetry in America's many initiatives to reach Middle and High School teachers and their 
students are taking root. Our first online course for Middle and High School Teachers, Poetry of 
the City, will launch this Spring with the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Companion 
materials to this course will be made available for free on PBS LearningMedia. This course is 
designed to meet the needs of English Language Arts and Social Studies teachers in the US and 
internationally. 
• We are eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for 
Middle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language 
Arts instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural  
world, conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the 
field with great teachers. 
• A recent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network 
of charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready 
educational material on The Poetry of Art Sport, and Play. This collection will include 
discussions on poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature 
dancers, athletes, fashion designers, and more. 
• With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems, 
we are eager to expand our reach and move into America's schools, disseminating, testing, 
and learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work 
evaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to 
produce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth. 
Working closely with such partners as The Nantucket Project, Nautilus Magazine, The Aspen Ideas 
Festival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard's provider of free open online 
courses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028951 
lifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky's  
"Shirt" (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part 
Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries. 
Growing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a 
fundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We've taken 
a big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our 
website— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and 
educational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch! 
Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The 
Leon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff I desperately needed 
to complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set 
down a solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public 
humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they 
heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts 
and Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video 
production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in 
producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard 
students. My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our 
collection for PBS LeamingMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the 
most consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year 
that make future projects that much more likely. If I can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling 
these coffers, I will be that much more able to keep working. 
I am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help 
you have offered to give in bringing them around. I have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten 
funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test, 
that video in schools as I proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where 
I could also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their 
character criteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe 
Biden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the 
platform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building 
literacy and character in the schools. 
It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking 
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it's always annoying but I always learn. 
With abundant gratitude, 
Lisa

The Fusion of Civilizations 
The Case for Global Optimism 
Foreign Affairs 
May/June 2016 issue 
By Kishore Mahbubani and Lawrence H. Summers 
The mood of much of the world is grim these days. Turmoil in the Middle 
East, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees; 
random terrorist attacks across the globe; geopolitical tensions in eastern 
Europe and Asia; the end of the commodity supercycle; slowing growth in 
China; and economic stagnation in many countries-all have combined to 
feed a deep pessimism about the present and, worse, the future. 
Historians looking back on this age from the vantage point of later 
generations, however, are likely to be puzzled by the widespread 
contemporary feelings of gloom and doom. By most objective measures of 
human well-being, the past three decades have been the best in history. 
More and more people in more and more places are enjoying better lives 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026840 
than ever before. Nor is this an accident-because despite Samuel 
Huntington's foreboding, what has occurred over recent generations is not a 
clash of civilizations but a fusion of civilizations. 
To put it simply, the great world civilizations, which used to have detached 
and separate identities, now have increasingly overlapping areas of 
commonality. Most people around the world now have the same aspirations 
as the Western middle classes: they want their children to get good 
educations, land good jobs, and live happy, productive lives as members of 
stable, peaceful communities. Instead of feeling depressed, the West should 
be celebrating its phenomenal success at injecting the key elements of its 
worldview into other great civilizations. 
The march of reason, triggered in the West by the Enlightenment, is 
spreading globally, leading to the emergence of pragmatic problem-solving 
cultures in every region and making it possible to envisage the emergence of 
a stable and sustainable rules-based order. There is every reason to believe, 
moreover, that the next few decades can be even better for humanity than 
the last few-so long as the West does not lose confidence in its core values 
and retreat from global engagement. The greatest danger of the current 
pessimism, therefore, is that it might become a self-fulfilling prophecy, 
leading to fear and withdrawal rather than attempts to reinvigorate the 
existing global system. 
The origins of the contemporary era lie in the West's transformation during 
the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. No 
other civilization can take credit for giving birth to modernity. This was not 
done with some benign intent to uplift humanity in general; there were 
many problems along the way, and the explosion of Western power across 
the globe had some terrible consequences for other cultures and regions. Yet 
the ultimate result was the diffusion of a modern outlook that relies on 
science and rationality to solve problems, much to the ultimate benefit of 
the planet's population. 
As recently as half a century ago, for example, there was a global clash of 
economic ideologies. Nikita Khrushchev, the former leader of the Soviet 
Union, could claim that the state was better at delivering basic goods to 
citizens than free markets were, but today such a view would be laughed at. 
The market economy has made Chinese and Indian workers today far more 
productive than they were under Mao Zedong or Jawaharlal Nehru, India's 
first prime minister. Societies now accept the simple fact that workers need 
material incentives to be productive, which has led to increased dignity and 
self-worth. The vast majority of humanity is literate, is at least somewhat 
mobile, and has access to the world's store of existing knowledge. Around 
half of the adults in the world own a smartphone, and there are now more 
connected mobile devices in total than there are people on the planet. 
The spread of science and technology, meanwhile, has also improved human 
dignity and well-being. Most people used to experience lives that were nasty, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026841 
brutish, and short. Today, life expectancy has increased by leaps and bounds 
virtually everywhere. Infant and maternal mortality have dropped sharply, 
thanks in part to the spread of clear hygiene standards and the construction 
of modern hospitals. According to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as 
recently as 1988, polio was rampant in 125 countries; today that number is 
down to two. Aside from among the Taliban and a few pockets of upscale 
communities in the United States, the virtues of vaccines are accepted by all, 
part of a general consensus on the virtues of Western science and 
technology. 
And reason is replacing superstition more generally. People around the 
world now routinely do basic cost-benefit analyses when looking for 
solutions to problems, leading to a gradual improvement in outcomes 
everywhere, from agriculture and construction to social and political life. 
This helps explain the dramatic long-term decline in the rates of most kinds 
of conflict and violence that the Harvard scholar Steven Pinker has 
documented. 
After slavery and imprisonment, the most degrading condition a human 
being can experience is poverty. In 2000, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
announced as one of the ambitious Millennium Development Goals halving 
extreme global poverty by 2015. That goal was far exceeded, and the U.S. 
National Intelligence Council has predicted that extreme poverty will be 
reduced even further by 203o-which would constitute one of the most 
remarkable developments in human history. The global middle class, 
meanwhile, is projected to rise from 1.8 billion in 2009 to 3.2 billion in 
2020 and 4.9 billion in 2030. The world's infant mortality rate decreased 
from an estimated 63 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 32 in 2015. This 
translates into more than four million fewer infant deaths each year. 
Instead of optimism based on this recent progress, however, these days in 
the West, one more often encounters pessimism related to three current 
challenges: turbulence in the Islamic world, the rise of China, and intra-
Western economic and political sclerosis. But the pessimism is 
unwarranted, because none of these three challenges is insurmountable. 
MODERNIZING MUSLIMS 
The Islamic world, from Morocco to Indonesia, comprises 1.6 billion 
citizens-more than one in five people on the planet. The vast majority of 
them share the common global aspirations to modernize their societies, 
achieve middle-class living standards, and lead peaceful, productive, and 
fulfilling lives. 
Contrary to what some assert, Islam is fully compatible with modernization. 
When Malaysia built the Petronas Towers and Dubai built Burj Khalifa, they 
were not just erecting physical structures but also sending a metaphysical 
message: we want to be part of the modern world in all dimensions. Many 
Islamic societies have educated their women. In Malaysian universities, the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026842 
women outnumber the men 65 percent to 35 percent. Even some Islamic 
countries that were initially reluctant to embrace modernization have begun 
to do so. For example, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates 
now feature satellite campuses of major Western universities. One reason 
for the shift is that the experience of other regions, such as Asia, has shown 
that modernization does not simply equal westernization-that it is possible 
to pursue, say, economic and social development while still retaining 
distinctive cultural characteristics. 
It is true that a certain number of young Muslims will continue to choose 
rebellion against the modern world rather than integration into it, joining 
radical Islamist groups and trying to wreak havoc where they can. About 
30,000 Muslim fighters from all over the world, including the West, have 
joined the Islamic State (also known as ISIS). But however much they 
constitute a major global security problem, they are dwarfed by, say, the 200 
million nonradical Muslims who live peacefully in Indonesia alone. 
Indonesia has elected two consecutive leaders committed to integrating the 
country into the modern world, and its largest Muslim organization, the 50-
million-plus-member Nandlatul Ulama, has publicly challenged ISIS' 
actions and ideology. 
The real challenge, therefore, is not the Islamic world per se but figuring out 
how to bolster the pro-modernization trends in that world while containing 
the radical trend. In retrospect, it was a mistake for the West to have 
remained silent when Saudi funding dramatically increased the number of 
radical madrasahs around the world. A comparable investment today in 
building a good modern school next to each radical one would create a 
contest for legitimacy that would likely spread Enlightenment values far and 
wide. Such a program could be undertaken by the UN agencies UNESCO 
and UNICEF at relatively modest cost, and it is only one of many possible 
lines of advance in attacking the problem. 
CHALLENGING CHINESE 
The second great challenge many worry about is the rise of China. China's 
success, however, can also be seen as the ultimate triumph of the West. The 
emperor Qianlong famously wrote to Great Britain's King George III in 1793 
saying, "Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and 
lacks no product within its own borders. There [is] therefore no need to 
import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own 
produce." Two centuries later, the Chinese understand that absorbing 
Western modernity into their society has been crucial to their country's 
reemergence. It has led to rapid economic growth, new and gleaming 
infrastructure, triumphs in space exploration, the spectacular 2008 Olympic 
Games in Beijing, and much more. 
Even as Chinese society has accepted modernity with great enthusiasm, 
however, it has not abandoned its Chinese cultural roots. The Chinese look 
at their modern Chinese civilization and emphasize its Chineseness, seeing 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026843 
no contradiction. Indeed, China is now experiencing its own cultural 
renaissance, fueled by its new affluence. 
The duality of the Chinese story is reflected in the West's schizophrenic 
response to it. The Nixon administration eagerly sought better relations with 
China under Mao, and when Deng Xiaoping doubled down by opening up 
the country, the West applauded the change. The United States generously 
accepted Chinese products into its markets, allowed massive trade 
surpluses, welcomed China into the World Trade Organization in 2001, and 
kept global sea-lanes open so that China could trade freely. All of this 
enabled China to emerge as the world's number one trading power by 2013. 
The United States also generously allowed more than a million Chinese 
students to study in its universities. 
Yet the rise of China has also led to deep fears. China continues to be run by 
a communist party that has no desire to embrace liberal democracy. China 
has displayed a belligerent side in some of its dealings with Japan and some 
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations over territorial 
disputes in the East China and South China Seas. The possibility of an 
aggressive, militaristic China cannot be ruled out. 
But we have come a vast distance since the days when Mao openly talked 
about the possibility of winning a nuclear war, and Chinese history suggests 
that Beijing will ultimately prefer to join, rather than replace or reject, the 
current rules-based order that the West has created. As the world's number 
one trading power, China has the most to lose from a breakdown of the 
global economic system. Historically, moreover, what the Chinese have 
feared most is luan (chaos). This might lead to heavy-handed efforts to 
preserve order domestically, but it should lead Beijing to support a rules-
based order at the global level as well. Undoubtedly, as China grows more 
powerful, it will become more assertive. This has happened. But since China 
needs a few more decades of peace to complete its modernization, it has 
strong reasons to restrain itself militarily and avoid a conflict. 
Chinese society will never become a replica of Western society. China's own 
culture is too rich to be absorbed into any other cultural universe. Yet a 
modernizing China will feature overlapping aspirations in many areas, as, 
for example, with the rapid spread of Western classical music. In 2008, 36 
million Chinese children were studying the piano (six times the number of 
U.S. children doing so), and another 50 million were studying the violin. 
Some Chinese cities can fill the halls of 15 opera houses in one evening. 
A modern China with thriving Western classical orchestras and Western-
style universities provides a powerful demonstration of the fusion of 
civilizations. Western statesmen should allow this dynamic to gain 
momentum while remaining patient on other areas of change, such as in the 
political realm. China's development will not necessarily be linear, but in the 
long run, it should continue in a positive direction. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026844 
PESSIMISTIC POPULISTS 
The third challenge today is a widespread loss of confidence in the West 
about its own systems and future potential. Sluggish growth across the 
developed world, stagnant incomes for much of the population, rising 
economic inequality, political gridlock, and the emergence of populist 
insurgencies on both sides of the political spectrum have fueled a 
widespread sense that Western models of governance and economic 
management are floundering. 
Many of these problems are real and important. But they are not beyond the 
capacity of determined leadership to solve, nor do they represent 
fundamental weaknesses of the Western model. So the pessimism strikes us 
as dramatically overdone, like previous bouts of declinism and worry that 
the West's best days were past. The greatest danger, in fact, is that the 
widespread pessimism will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Gloomy 
Western policymakers and publics are more likely to see threats than 
opportunities and to turn away from the world rather than continue to lead 
it successfully. 
This is notable in the rising opposition, for example, to the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership, a major trade deal that would help extend and deepen the 
liberal order across a broad swath of the globe. It is evident in the increasing 
suspicion of immigrants and refugees and in the growing support for closing 
borders. And it can be seen in the fraying and potential unraveling of 
international institutions such as the European Union, formerly a model of 
progressive international integration. 
It would be a terrible shame if the West walked away from the very 
international order that it created after World War II and that has facilitated 
so much security, prosperity, and development over the decades. Instead, it 
should try to reinvigorate that order, with three moves in particular: 
working with China and India, bolstering international rules, and 
accentuating the positive global trends that get lost in all the hysteria about 
the negative ones. 
Why China and India? Because they have the largest populations and 
economies in the developing world, are led by strong, reform-minded 
leaders, and are approaching the future with dynamism, optimism, and 
hope. Both understand that they need to take on greater responsibilities in 
confronting global problems, and as last fall's Paris climate agreement 
demonstrates, they are already starting to do so. 
Although China's rise has been one of the universally acknowledged 
wonders of the age, India's recent rise has been impressive as well, as India, 
too, has embraced modernization, globalization, and Enlightenment 
rationalism. Along the way, India has maintained the world's largest 
democracy, successfully accommodated an amazingly diverse cultural and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026845 
demographic mosaic, and kept its head and its values even under repeated 
terrorist attacks. 
Although both are Asian powers, they differ so much that developing the 
capacity to work closely with both, and learning from each, would be a 
major step forward in mastering the management of a truly global order. 
The rapid spread of Western-style universities and orchestras in China will 
provide new bridges between China and the West. The exceptionally 
successful ethnic Indian community in the United States will provide 
bridges with India. And all this cooperation will accentuate the process of 
civilizational fusion. 
In contrast to China and India, Russia has held back from thoroughly 
embracing modernity, even though the Soviet Union started modernizing 
before China and India. Russia hesitated to join the World Trade 
Organization and has not yet accepted that ungrudging participation in the 
current rules-based order can facilitate its own progress. The more Beijing 
and New Delhi prosper, however, the more persuasive will be the case for 
Moscow to follow their lead. 
As it works closely with the major developing powers, the West should also 
step up its efforts to construct a robust rules-based world in general. In 
2003, former U.S. President Bill Clinton said that Americans should try "to 
create a world with rules and partnerships and habits of behavior that we 
would like to live in when we're no longer the military, political, economic 
superpower in the world." If Clinton's fellow citizens could accept such 
advice, the citizens of most other countries would be willing to do the same. 
And this might be easier to achieve than many believe. 
Much of today's global multilateral architecture was a valuable gift from the 
West to the world. Yet the major Western powers have also made sure that 
these institutions have never grown strong enough or independent enough 
to make real trouble for their creators. UN secretary-generals have been 
creatures of the permanent members of the Security Council, the leaders of 
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been drawn 
exclusively from the United States and Europe, and dominance in these 
financial institutions has occasionally been exploited to achieve extra-
financial goals. These policies should be reconsidered, for the legitimacy of 
the system depends on the perception that its rules are developed by and 
applied fairly and equally to all, rather than that they cater to the narrow 
interests of a few. Picking strong leaders for the major international 
institutions and keeping those institutions' operations from being 
undermined or politicized would be a major step forward. 
Western policymakers, finally, should work to highlight the good things that 
are happening around the world rather than harp on the bad things. 
Hundreds of millions of people have emerged from poverty in recent 
decades even as military conflicts have decreased. The convergence of global 
aspirations means that a vast majority of countries want to see evolution 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026846 
trump revolution in the reshaping of the global architecture. The 
appearance of pressing transnational problems should drive a convergence 
of interests toward cooperation in finding common solutions. And the 
presence of large, well-educated middle classes in countries around the 
globe will help keep governments on the right track. 
There is every reason to be confident that the condition of the world will 
continue to improve as pragmatism and the use of reason become universal. 
Western universities have been a crucial driver of this trend. It is not just 
that their curricula have been copied around the world; the entire ecosystem 
of a modern research university is being replicated, and it is the graduates of 
these Western-style universities who have in turn introduced modern 
methods into education, public health, economic management, and public 
policy more generally. Global management consulting firms have also 
contributed to progress, spreading best practices and good ideas from the 
West to "the rest," and increasingly from the rest back to the West. As a 
result, even formerly desperate and dysfunctional countries, such as 
Bangladesh and Ethiopia, are now confidently entering the modern 
universe. 
In short, despite the daily headlines that scream doom and gloom, the world 
is actually coming together, not falling apart. So far, the fusion of 
civilizations has been driven primarily by the injection of Western DNA into 
other civilizations. Over time, the flow of culture and ideas is likely to go in 
both directions. This has already happened in cuisine, where global 
influences have thoroughly penetrated Western kitchens, and something 
similar should happen across cultural sectors. 
There will be challenges. There could even be major setbacks. The fusion of 
civilizations and the social and economic changes associated with it can 
seem threatening to some, creating opportunities for demagogues to exploit 
popular fears, even in the heart of the advanced industrial world. But 
increasingly open and enlightened societies are likely to avoid this danger. 
In the twenty-first century, the world will be governed more by the authority 
of ideas than by the idea of authority. In short, the progressive direction of 
human history, which has lifted the human condition to heights never seen 
before, is set to continue.

Pardon the formality below - I want to approach your very legitimate questions / concerns in a serious 
manner. 
Attached and below the same. 
Dear Jeffrey: 
As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV 
series "The Science of Sleep and Dreams": 
(i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional 
understandings) to justify a major TV series? 
(ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for 
corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? 
In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, 
Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at 
length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More 
importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in 
related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the "Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams" (2012) and 
the sole author of the forthcoming "An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams" (Cambridge 
University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for 
graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. 
When we asked Patrick, his first response — "This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story" — and he 
cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well 
corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper 
understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and 
established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and 
pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes 
(e.g., PTSD and Depression). 
To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that 
there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-
movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement 
gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves 
(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is 
Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has 
been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and 
confirmed in very recent years (as explained below). 
Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025191 
now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the 
public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams 
essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. 
Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory 
consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. 
Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many 
neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, 
Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and 
Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. 
This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact 
that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of 
dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with 
rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated" 
(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is 
why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that 
the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and 
dreams can enhance creativity. 
As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: "It would be nice if we could talk about sleep 
and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. 
Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of 
post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed." 
Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. 
Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive 
that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that 
going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various 
non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a 
stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that 
fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This 
gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are "genetic conflict" studies 
with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and 
differences between males and females in which genes get "imprinted". 
Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new 
neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a 
vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in 
the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in 
the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why 
REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). 
Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only 
in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and 
statistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, 
including cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size 
and structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. 
Patterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. 
Males will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers 
are often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness 
by the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) 
"Lucid Dreaming" is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer "knows" that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025192 
he/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be 
trained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering 
their brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). 
Neuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is 
itself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now 
enables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In 
REM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is "down-regulated", whereas the limbic system is "up-regulated", 
showing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will 
enable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) 
Patrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding 
sleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the "purpose" of sleep and dreams, as well 
as engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). 
Attached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, 
especially 2015-2017). 
You'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want. 
Love to do this series together with you. 
Much appreciate and warm regards, 
Robert

Hi Jeffrey, I was happy to meet you this morning.

You asked to see some things I've written. Here's my (only slightly out of date) professional web presence, including 
Letterman clip:

Here are a few stories I've written more recently that are not displayed on my site:

You might get a special kick out of this Trump story:

What kinds of media goals/story ideas are interesting to you? Masha has made it clear that she wants me to write 
something about you, but that's much more your call to make. I suggest that there is mileage to be gained by quoting you 
in a story about how proper implementation of cryptocurrency might solve financial corruption issues. 
I travel back to Austin, Texas tomorrow evening, but am of course reachable. Thanks again for your time this morning.

How's all in our crazy world? 
I'm in NY until August 31 (then again, after Beijing, Sept. 25 — Oct. 14). If you are in town, meet? 
When convenient, I'd like you to meet Peter Getzels, Closer To Truth producer/director (I've worked with 
Peter for 12 years); he would very much like to meet you in person, describe the Radical Breakthroughs 
process in detail, get your feedback. He would come up from DC. We can always do Skype, of course, but 
Peter would appreciate to meet in person early in the process. Breakthroughs is a Big Project, big opportunity 
for impact. All are truly excited. 
Below are highlights of Breakthroughs progress. 
Attached is latest CNN on trade war and below are links (caution: a few weeks old is ancient history in Trump 
time).

Radical Breakthrough Development Work 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029295 
• Research on each of the 13 episodes is ongoing and we are moving towards creating a short list of the top 
contributors per episode (with some contributors in multiple episodes). 
• We are aggregating the top contributors around 4 to 5 central locations, such as SF Bay Area, LA, Chicago, 
Boston, New York, Santa Fe, London, Oxford, and Cambridge for the main shoots. 
• We are creating a short list of locations for the secondary shoot - i.e. the more observational shoots on 
specific labs and research facilities, such as the Music Lab at McGill, the Sleep Lab at Harvard. 
• We are planning a recce in the autumn to assess locations and meet some of the key contributors. 
• We've brought on a production manager / line producer as we develop detailed research, contributors, 
locations, budgets. 
• Our team is working toward interviewing and hiring a top science-literate associate producer / dedicated 
research producer. We've been coordinating with colleagues at HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Association) 
as well as National Geographic for staffing referrals, and now have a strong short list. This is a critical, long-
term position. 
• We are assessing graphics and animation companies and researching styles and graphic ideas that we might 
use to communicate some of the more complex ideas. 
• Our digital team is researching a web extension for the www.closertotruth.com website, developing ideas for 
a dedicated site neighborhood for "Radical Breakthroughs." We are in discussions with several website 
design companies, including the company that designed and built our original CTT site, for ideas and bids on 
creating the expanded site. 
• By mid-October, we expect to begin to schedule the shoots.
