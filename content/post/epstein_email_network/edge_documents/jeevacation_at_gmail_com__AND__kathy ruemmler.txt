Former Obama lawyer nixes attorney general offer 
Former White House counsel turns down chance to succeed Eric Holder as attorney 
general 
By NEDRA PICKLER 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler has told President Barack Obama 
she doesn't want to be nominated for attorney general, after he asked her to consider succeeding Eric Holder, 
people familiar with the discussions told The Associated Press on Friday. 
Ruemmler was concerned that her experience as a close adviser to the president would have led to a difficult 
confirmation process in the current highly charged partisan environment, the sources said, speaking on a 
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private discussions. They say Ruemmler, a 
top official at the Justice Department before moving to the White House, was also concerned that could ignite 
political attacks against Obama. 
Ruemmler's withdrawal, in a phone call to the president Wednesday, leaves no obvious front-runner to replace 
Holder, who announced a month ago that he would step down once a replacement was confirmed. Ruemmler 
brought the law enforcement bonafides of a former prosecutor in the Bush administration who won convictions 
against Enron's executives and the national security expertise of a top White House official. 
Other candidates that administration officials have said have been considered include Solicitor General Don 
Verrilli; Labor Secretary Tom Perez; Loretta Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Preet 
Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York; Jenny Durkan, who resigned as U.S. attorney in 
Washington state last month; former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano; Tony West, who recently 
resigned as the No. 3 official at the Justice Department and has taken a job at Pepsico; and Deputy Homeland 
Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 
Ruemmler, now a partner at Latham & Watkins specializing in government investigations, had the closest 
relationship of the attorney general candidates to the president after serving as his legal gatekeeper at the White 
House. But that relationship also would have brought tough scrutiny, with Republicans likely to question her 
handling of controversies involving the IRS, Benghazi and the investigation of a White House volunteer in a 
prostitution scandal. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026605 
Obama's aides say he has not yet made up his mind on whom to nominate and won't announce a choice until 
after the Nov. 4 elections, in part to avoid making the nominee into a political issue facing embattled 
Democratic candidates. They say he also hasn't decided whether to seek confirmation in the Senate's lame duck 
session later this year or to wait until the new year, when Republicans are expected to pick up seats if not win 
outright control. 
White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said in a statement, "Kathy is someone who always tells it like it 
is, is a world class lawyer and remains a trusted adviser to the president. Anyone who knows Kathy knows she 
has impeccable judgment, extraordinary foresight and is a formidable force. But she is also as selfless as they 
come, and the president is proud to call her a close friend."

Perhaps you should suggest Jefferey talk to Joe Lockhart at the Glover Park Group. He has helped Clinton

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022696 
Carlo Allegri / Reuters 
Over roughly the past month, coverage of Bill Clinton's travels with financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have made 
their way from a thick stack of court documents into something approaching political mythology, propelled by a string of 
innuendo-laced reports hinting that the former president must have been in some way complicit when he voyaged with a 
billionaire known for preying on underage girls. 
It's a story with plenty to gape at, from horrific and excruciatingly detailed allegations against Epstein to the frequent presence of 
a former president who was, after all, nearly chased from office for a (consensual) affair with an intern. 
But sometimes stories that seem too good to be true —just might be. A detailed review by a team of BuzzFeed News reporters of 
more than 2,000 pages of pleadings, depositions, affidavits, police reports, flight logs, and other documents filed in state and 
federal court found that many of the most provocative allegations about Clinton have little to no factual foundation and are 
exaggerated at best; that the documents — which appear to be the source for nearly all current reporting on this subject — 
themselves never suggest that Clinton was doing more than using his wealthy friend as a kind of global taxi service; and that 
many of the most lurid insinuations have been floated without any visible support from verifiable information. 
While it's still possible that some Rosetta stone of Clintonian depravity will surface from a pair of ongoing lawsuits involving 
Epstein, the fact that nothing even close to that has been dug up over the course of a half-dozen years of heated litigation should 
not be encouraging for Republican operatives and other Clinton critics hotly anticipating the very worst. 
One sign that the connection is a bit weak: The lawyers who have used the Clinton link to help publicize their cases have been 
markedly vague on details. 
When asked to present actual proof, Jack Scarola, the Florida attorney responsible for filing some of the most attention-grabbing 
documents that have come to light in recent weeks, warned darkly in an email of "extortionate threats, power, wealth or political 
pressure." 
"The time will come when all your questions will be answered," said Scarola, who represents another trial attorney suing Epstein in 
Palm Beach County Court. "But that time is not now." 
Unwilling to wait, perhaps, publications on both sides of the Atlantic have gleefully dipped into those documents to publish 
of Epstein's "black book," which contains a host of Clinton phone numbers (along with just about every 
other powerful figure in the Western world); dissections of handwritten flight logs for the financier's private 727 aircraft that 
frequently capture Bubba at 30,000 feet; and extensive allegations from a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was Epstein's 
sex slave as a teenager and whose recollection places the former commander-in-chief on "Orgy Island" in 2002 to participate in a 
sexual romp, possibly with women who were not yet of age.

YORK & 'ORGY ISLAND,' SAYS TEEN SEX SLAVE 
View this image 
National Enquirer 
Tellingly, many of those articles — which have notably increased in tempo in recent weeks following Roberts' late December 
accusation that noted attorney Alan Dershowitz was one of the men she was forced to have sex with — contain language 
underscoring the fact that none of this proves anything. "It should at this stage be stressed that the Mail has no evidence to 
corroborate this and other claims made by Virginia Roberts," the Daily Mailwrote in April. "Though her LinkedIn page claims a 
certificate in Swedish massage, there is no evidence that she ever actually treated Epstein to one," Gawker (in the 
straightforward and clearest reporting on the documents to date) wrote last week. And the National Enquirer did not appear to 
rely on the court record for its conclusions, instead to the interpretation of an unnamed source who noted that "Bill's name is all 
over the legal papers, which are chock-full of sordid claims." 
Clinton's discretion on matters of sexual restraint has attained permanent notoriety, so maybe it's natural to assume that particular 
leopard doesn't change his spots. But at this point, there is simply nothing to back those sordid claims up. 
Here's what we do know: 
Jeffrey Epstein is a secretive billionaire financier and Democratic donor who says he never attended college but whose 
"background is in physics." He owns properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, London, and Paris and also owns an island in 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. He has at least two private jets, including the 727. 
He has known Bill Clinton since about 1995, and his relationship with him grew stronger after he left office. There is no question 
they were friendly. Epstein's so-called "black book," which is less like something out of the Heidi Fleiss affair and more what most 
people would call a "phone directory," contains 21 numbers for getting in touch with Clinton, as well as emails and addresses. 
But that 92-page directory also contains exactly the range of eye-poppingly famous and powerful contacts one might expect of an 
incredibly rich, connected person who owns Manhattan's largest private residence, from Tony Blair to Elie Wiesel to Courtney 
Love. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022698 
Epstein was long rumored to be a sexual libertine; "It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do," real estate 
personality Donald Trump once said of his old friend. "And many of them are on the younger side."

Epstein, in his Florida sex offender photo; at right, a phone message to Epstein from a modeling agent offering Russian lessons 
from a "2x8" year old girl. 
In 2006, that reputation caught up with him, when he was arrested by the Palm Beach Police on charges of sexually molesting 
numerous underage girls. Police reports in the court record show that detectives found Epstein regularly paid very young women 
to give him massages that he turned into sexual encounters. He allegedly had a preference for very young women, whom he 
carefully groomed into increasingly extreme situations, including what some, including Roberts, allege to be sexual slavery. 
In total, 40 women were identified as possible victims of sexual abuse by Epstein, many of them teenagers at the time, including 
some younger than 14 years old. Epstein was originally charged with a variety of crimes, including sexual assault, rape, and 
witness tampering. 
He avoided most of those charges as well as federal prosecution in late 2007 by agreeing to plead guilty in Florida court, a deal 
that Dershowitz, who was one of Epstein's lawyers, helped negotiate along with an all-star legal lineup that interestingly also 
included famed Clinton-hunter Ken Starr. 
In the end, Epstein got 18 months in prison for a single count of soliciting an underage prostitute, of which he served 13 months. 
He is now a registered sex offender who lists his primary residence as the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
In a pleading late last month in federal court, attorneys for Roberts allege that "Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a 
provision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution." Dershowitz has denied these charges vigorously, 
calling them "salacious and false" and, possibly more importantly, "completely irrelevant" in a Jan. 12 filing. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022700 
Despite what some called among the most exhaustive investigations in Palm Beach Police history — which dug up such evidence 
as an Amazon receipt for Epstein's purchase of titles including "Training With Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Exotic Slaves and 
Their Owners" — there is nothing in the police record suggesting any other men were involved in Epstein's predatory behavior.

The criminal case provoked numerous lawsuits from women alleging they were victims of Epstein's proclivities, followed by 
with more than two dozen of them. One firm bringing some of those cases employed a young lawyer named Bradley 
Edwards, who managed some of the cases. In 2009, a founding partner at the firm, Scott Rothstein, fled the country before 
ultimately returning to plead guilty of running a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme built around recruiting investors to buy stakes in 
litigation settlements that turned out to be phony. 
As details of the fraud emerged, Epstein sued Rothstein and Edwards in Palm Beach County Court for racketeering, alleging, 
among other things, that they dangled Bill Clinton's association with Epstein as a lure to investors, implying that settlements would 
be fast and sizable. Epstein ultimately dropped his suit in 2012, but by that time, Edwards had countersued for malicious 
prosecution and abuse of process. 
, along with a claim by Virginia Roberts against the federal government over the 2007 prosecution deal in district court 
(which she filed as a "Jane Doe" in 2008), are still pending and are the source of most of the scant information about Clinton that 
has appeared. Scarola, who in the past sued Chiquit over payments to violent leftist Colombian rebels and won a $1.45 billion 
verdict over Morgan Stanley (that was later overturned), is the lawyer bringing the suit in county court in West Palm Beach, while 
Paul Cassell, a former federal judge known for his critical take on mandatory-minimum sentences, mans the federal case four 
blocks away. 
Neither Cassell nor Edwards responded to requests for comment. 
It is primarily from pleadings in those cases that the press has been getting a glimpse inside the lifestyle of Epstein, and, by 
extension, Clinton. "Edwards had sound legal basis for believing former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022701 
information," part of one pleading reads. Roberts, in her case, alleges that Epstein forced her "to be sexually exploited by 
Defendant's adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal 
acquaintances," which, Edwards elsewhere claims, are "categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into." 
Police reports entered into the record go into stomach-wrenching detail about Epstein's alleged exploits with the girls and women 
he recruited and paid for massages that became sexual acts, and mention other women participating as well. Epstein's longtime 
friend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, is accused of taking part, while his personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, is described procuring 
young woman for him. 
But neither of those women has ever said a word about Clinton being involved. Maxwell, for her part, has never been deposed. 
She canceled a deposition in 2010, claiming she had to return to England indefinitely due to family illness, but was soon thereafter 
photographed by Us Weekly at Chelsea Clinton's wedding in Rhinebeck, New York.

For her part, Kellen, who won immunity from prosecution along with Epstein in 2007, did sit for a deposition, but repeatedly 
pleaded the Fifth, refusing to even say if she'd ever even met the former president. 
Epstein's much-discussed flight logs show fairly conclusively that she has. 
A review of the handwritten documents shows Clinton taking 13 trips in Epstein's specially outfitted Boeing 727, including a much-
discussed trip to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. In every single instance, the logs show, Kellen was also on the plane, 
as was Epstein. That may sound suspicious, except for the fact that Kellen has been described as Epstein's right hand, profoundly 
involved in his professional activities as well as personal ones. Indeed, Doug Band, Clinton's personal aide, was on all but one of 
the flights the former president took on Epstein's jet.

Among the other people who most frequently flew with Clinton are Maxwell and Adriana Ross (formerly Adriana Mucinska), 
another Epstein assistant and a former model. The logs also show him flying with former advisor Ira Magaziner, ex-Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater, and fashion model Naomi Campbell. 
The pilots' documents also leave numerous and — understandably — intriguing questions unanswered: Clinton was on four flights 
with women identified as only "Janice" and "Jessica," who have not been identified; he once flew with a person identified only as 
"one female" and also, during part of the trip throughout Africa, a young woman named Chauntae Davies, who appears in 
Epstein's phone directly under the massage category and whose expertise in Swedish massage was described in Gawkey's story 
mentioning her last week. And because the entries are hand-written in a very cramped log form, it's impossible to know if 
important names ended up illegible or left out altogether, nor if there are other logs that have not been revealed. 
But based on what's in the court files, there are no further clues about those flights, other than the testimony and public 
statements of Roberts, who has described the airplane as a kind of high-altitude Gomorrah. What is on the record is a deposition 
of Larry Visoski, one of Epstein's former pilots, who recalls having Clinton on his plane as many as 20 times. When asked, "Do you 
remember him being on the airplane with younger girls?" Visoski replies, simply, "No." 
Clinton flew literally around the world with Epstein, traveling from New York to London, to Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, 
Morocco, Portugal, Russia, and throughout Africa. In almost every case, according to cross-referenced information on his speaking 
engagements, Clinton was apparently traveling for professional reasons, and, according to the logs, he never flew with his wealthy 
friend anywhere near the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
That does little to bolster statements by Roberts, who in a 2011 conversation with her lawyers (which both New York Posts Page 
Sixand Radar Online described as an "interview") claimed Clinton traveled to Epstein's infamous retreat on Little St. James Island 
in 2002. 
Earlier this month, it was reported that Roberts is writing a "tell-all" memoir about her experiences. In a sworn affidavit filed in 
court last week, she claimed to have had sex with Epstein, Dershowitz, England's Prince Andrew, and several other men on 
numerous occasions, and portrayed a three-year period ending in 2002 when Epstein passed her off to his friends continually. But, 
she added, "I have never had sexual relations with Clinton, nor have I claimed to have had such relations. 
have sexual relations with anyone."

Intensive coverage prompted by the court filings has hinted that Clinton abruptly ceased his flying with Epstein in 2005, not 
terribly long before he was arrested, "perhaps because of events related to Epstein's sexual abuse of children." The implication is 
that Clinton may have known trouble of the worst kind was coming and decided to get out while he could. In fact, the logs show 
all of Clinton's flights came in 2002 and 2003, with not a single appearance aloft recorded in 2004 or 2005. 
The closest potential link to Clinton in the period closer to Epstein's fall, the public record suggests, comes from one of his 
longtime confidants, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. 
The flight logs indicate Summers flew on Epstein's jet as far back as 1998, but also on April 15, 2004, September 14, 2005, and 
December 21, 2005. The final trip came 10 days after Summers got married, and the log for the flight — from Bedford, 
Massachusetts, to the Virgin Islands — shows what appears to be his new bride on board, as well as Ghislaine Maxwell, but not 
Epstein.

Epstein was a significant donor to Harvard University, of which Summers was president at the time. According to a spokesperson 
for Summers, on a few occasions when Epstein was flying to where Summers was also traveling, he accepted rides on the 
billionaire's jet. 
Attorneys in the two cases have attempted to get the court to permit discovery from Clinton himself, but have been stymied by 
motions from Epstein's lawyers. Court records show they have also tried unsuccessfully to depose Donald Trump, former New 
Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, and magician David Copperfield. Notably, a list of 73 
proposed witnesses in Roberts' trial does not include Clinton. 
The tale of Epstein and his sexual activities is undoubtedly a fascinating, and harrowing, one. But with the star witness in one case 
swearing under oath that she has no such evidence, and everyone else in a position to know keeping their mouths firmly shut, it is 
at this point extremely difficult to draw even a hazy, crooked, dotted line between Epstein's depredations, in the bedroom or aloft, 
and William Jefferson Clinton.

Going up to NY Friday morning. Think I am going to drive. I will then stop to pee and get gas at a rest stop on 
the New Jersey turnpike, will observe all of the people there who are at least 100 pounds overweight, will have 
a mild panic attack as a result of the observation, and will then decide that I am not eating another bite of food

Mr. Weinberg — 
I am a reporter with the ABC News investigative unit. We are gathering background research on the major 
candidates for President. 
Seeing that both former President Clinton and Mr. Trump have been mentioned in connection to the Jeffrey 
Epstein case, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that 
could help explain Mr. Epstein's dealings and interactions with both men. 
I would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation at 
your earliest convenience. 
Please let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet. 
Many thanks, 
Matthew

We will of course do this in whatever sequence makes sense for you. It goes without saying that any move 
would need to make economic sense. My assumption has been that your comp would fall outside of our "bell 
curve", but that is not an issue for us as long as the potential contribution also falls outside. You would not be 
the only partner outside the curve, and I am comfortable with expanding that group for people who can 
genuinely move the needle while embracing the culture that makes us who we are. 
One benefit of having Michael in the mix is that he can provide a global perspective, and he would be important 
for explaining the case outside the US if we moved forward. 
Just let me know when and how you want to speak next.

Subject: Patterson 
To: Jeffrey Epstein <j eevacation@gmail.com> 
A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be able 
to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a 
sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have 
some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you 
frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical 
proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the 
lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps 
some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, expensive 
effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely 
be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp 
up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered 
before. 
Meanwhile--
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032246 
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's "authorship" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's "authorship" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be 
able to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a 
sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have 
some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting 
you frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and 
technical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something 
along the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and 
perhaps some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, 
expensive effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely 
be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp 
up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered 
before. 
Meanwhile--

In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity 
Fair, has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's "authorship" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

that is what Trump told him as they have been getting a lot of questions from reporters about you. 
He actually seemed to be a sensible guy/solid reporter -- just from the few conversations I had with

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030098 
A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East's most prominent banks did not commit fraud and 
steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership 
collapsed. 
Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment 
system because it didn't want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan's technology to launch its own service. 
The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan's technology. It argued that it cancelled the 
partnership because InfoSpan couldn't produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an 
established company, not one with little to no track record. 
After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and theft 
of trade secrets. 
InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the 
possibility of an appeal. 
The verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile attorneys 
on both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama. 
At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a 
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back 
home through text messages. 
Bajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the business 
and technology. 
To launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled 
by the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund. 
It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine 
company that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s 
The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-made 
market for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply than 
Western Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system. 
A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal's 
fifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees. 
But the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009. 
A few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they 
defrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology. 
Two years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was working 
and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to launch its 
own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan's technology. 
In court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it abhorred 
how much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm. 
"They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money," attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing 
arguments Wednesday. 
Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator David 
Boies — argued that the bank resorted to "pure extortion" in an attempt to get its way. 
As a result of the bank's criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa's partner, Larry Scudder, was detained at 
the Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours until 
he secured his release by turning over his passport. 
According to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told Scudder's passport would be released 
and he could leave the country only if InfoSpan gave up ownership and control of SpanCash to the bank. 
Six months later, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and Scudder got his passport back, but SpanCash's 
reputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The Times. 
The bank disputed that it acquired InfoSpan's source code or used it at any time. 
Former White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never would 
have acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such 
technology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership. 
In her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and InfoSpan 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030099 
sold the bank a "bill of goods," arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never worked and 
InfoSpan wasn't as big a company as it claimed. 
The bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the 
bank's money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan's employees, Ruemmler told 
the jury. 
"They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded," she said. 
Lubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that "Emirates 
Bank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts." 
Bajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn't know his next steps. 
"I am just beat up," he said.

A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East's most prominent banks did not commit fraud 
and steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their 
partnership collapsed. 
Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment

I'll soon send a cleaner version of this and other coverage, but wanted to share the article just posted in the 
AmLaw Litigation Daily. A personal thanks to Dan for speaking to the reporter, and Nima for feeding us case 
documents and insights. 
http://m.litigationdaily.com/#/article/1202765052511/1/A%20Master%20at%20Work:%20Dissecting%20the

A Master at Work: Dissecting the Closing Argument in Latham's Huge Win for Middle Eastern Bank 
Jenna Greene08/14/2016 
For Latham & Watkins, defending a Middle Eastern bank accused of stealing trade secrets from a plucky 
American entrepreneur could have been a tough sell to a federal jury in Orange County, California. 
[http://www.law.com/image/LitDaily/DailyDicta.jpg]The stakes were high--more than half a billion dollars in 
damages--and some of the facts were, ahem, challenging. 
How did Latham lawyers turn a potentially unsympathetic narrative into a unanimous win for Dubai-based 
Emirates NBD Bank PJSC on Thursday? 
A look at closing arguments by Latham partner Kathryn Ruemmler, who made her first in-court appearance 
since she stepped down as White House counsel in 2014, is revealing in a watch-the-master-at-work kind of 
way. 
Along with Latham partners Daniel Schecter and Dean Dunlavey, she faced off against an equally formidable 
opponent: Boies, Schiller & Flexner partner William Isaacson, who wasnamed a litigator of the 
year<http://www.americanlawyer.com/id= 1202745123270/Litigator-of-the-Year-William-Isaacson-of-Boies-
Schiller> by The American Lawyer in 2015. 
Ruemmler parachuted into the case on May 20, replacing Steven Bauer. He had another case (on behalf of 
Pacific Gas & Electric<http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202764714611/Split-Verdict-in-PGE-Pipeline-Blast-
Case?slreturn=20160712215338>) going to trial at the same time and couldn't convince U.S. District Judge 
James Selna to push back the trial date, which had already been delayed several times. 
This was the lay of the land: Two weeks before, the Los Angeles Times on May 8 had run a lengthy 
feature<http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-infospan-lawsuit-20160508-story.html> that was distinctly 
sympathetic to the plaintiff, Farooq Bajwa. A former computer components manufacturer/ El Pollo Loco 
franchise owner, his latest venture was a company called InfoSpan Inc. 
Bajwa is portrayed as a visionary who had an idea to allow foreign workers to easily and cheaply send funds 
back to relatives in their home country via the internet or cell phone. 
"I realized I might make a big difference in this world not only helping these underprivileged people who don't 
have bank accounts, I will also be helping bring an economic revolution," Bajwa, 64, told the paper. "I had 
very big dreams." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012038 
But after he struck a deal with Emirates NBD to roll out his product, SpanCash, he claimed the bank stole his 
proprietary technology, killed the deal and ruined his company. (Though it's hard to feel too sorry for him--
he's pictured in front of his house, a mansion that would put Versailles to shame. In this David-and-Goliath 
story, he's a David from the 1 percent.) 
Bajwa sought $554 million plus punitive damages on trade secret misappropriation and misrepresentation 
claims. 
Trial began on July 26 in U.S. District Court for Central District of California. On Aug. 10, Ruemmler and 
Isaacson summed up their opposing positions in closing arguments. 
Let's take a look. 
I Isaacson, who did not respond to a request for comment, led with one of his strongest cards: USA! USA! 
"We as a country, made up of flawed people, come together as one of the greatest countries on Earth, because 
we are a nation of laws," he said, according to a transcript of the proceedings. "This was about hard work and 
what happens when your work is destroyed and taken, how you're entitled to be treated under the laws of the 
United States." 
For Ruemmler, the appeal was not emotional or jingoistic. It was rational all the way. 
Her first line: "Mr. Bajwa has come up with an interesting story, but it's not what happened." 
And then, in the most matter-of-fact, conversational way, she annihilated his case. 
"There are at least five fatal flaws in Mr. Bajwa's case, and any one of those alone sinks his case. Any one," 
she said, according to the transcript. 
Bajwa couldn't prove that SpanCash was ever fully functional and commercially ready, Ruemmler said. In 
fact, she argued, it was never even a real product. 
Further, she said, Bajwa didn't prove that the technology or platform was comprised of any trade secrets; or 
that Emirates Bank stole SpanCash; or that it ever used it. Finally, Bajwa didn't prove InfoSpan suffered any 
damages, she said. 
Some of her turns of phrase are refreshingly non-lawyerly. "Sham is going down there... It's not as if these 
guys were exactly rubes...This is some flimflam thing... One of the many, many dog-ate-my-homework 
excuses ....This is an absolute double-down lie." 
The overall effect: she simplified without being condescending. 
But there was still a hurdle for Emirates. Or as Latham's Schecter put it in an interview, "There are some facts 
we wouldn't script." 
After the bank terminated its agreement with InfoSpan and demanded its investment back, Infospan's deputy 
CEO, Larry Scudder, was arrested when he tried to leave the UAE. 
"At the Dubai Airport that day, the Dubai police arrested Mr. Scudder after he presented his passport at an 
electronic terminal. Police told Mr. Scudder that a charge of criminal fraud had been filed against him for 
$1,465,000. Mr. Scudder was handcuffed and marched through the airport and then held in police detention 
facilities and interrogated," the complaint states. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012039 
He was handcuffed to a chair, then transferred to a cell with 30 people before being released 19 hours later, at 
1 am. And then, the police kept his passport for six months before he could finally leave the country. 
On the stand, he cried when he spoke about the ordeal. 
Isaacson in his closing repeatedly called it extortion. "Because when the bank held Mr. Scudder's passport--I'm 
sorry, caused his passport to held, that just didn't cause personal pain for Mr. Scudder," he said. "What it did 
was give the opportunity for the bank to control the technology, to control the situation, because now InfoSpan 
couldn't compete in the UAE because of the fears that this type of thing would happen. And it also gave him 
the opportunity to try and extort money and control of the technology from InfoSpan." 
How do you counter that? 
Ruemmler was not available for an interview, but Schecter said pretrial research showed people expect that if 
you do business overseas, you'll comply with the laws of the foreign country. And in UAE, this is how they 
handle fraud. 
"Judge Selna has instructed you that filing a criminal complaint in Dubai for fraud is a common practice and 
that if you've been cheated, that's what you're supposed to do," Ruemmler said. 
What about Scudder's emotional testimony? 
She undercut it without coming across as callous--a fine line. 
"Now, I have to mention the tears. And this is the only thing I'm going to say about it," Ruemmler said. "He 
was detained for less than 24 hours, nine years ago; and then, he was in his corporate apartment and had 
$300,000 to live for, like, about six months. I'm just going to say this: I will leave to you to evaluate the 
sincerity of those tears in light of all the other evidence that you have heard in this case." 
And then she immediately talked about how he "basically, had faked a document." 
It worked. After about a day of deliberation, the jury found across the board for Emirates NBD Bank. 
"It was a binary case--either they lied or we lied," said Schecter. "The plaintiff's strategy was all or nothing. 
There were no off-ramps for the jury." 
The Latham team also included counsel Andrew Fossum and associates Nima Mohebbi, Stephanie Grace, 
Jonathan Sandler, Jacquelyn Levien, Elizabeth Greenman, Pushkal Mishra and Tom Rickeman. 
In a statement to The Lit Daily, Lubna Qassim, chief group general counsel and company secretary of the 
Emirates NBD, said, "While there was no basis for this case being tried in U.S. courts, Emirates NBD Bank is 
deeply gratified by the jury's decision and appreciates the court's commitment to ensuring a fair trial."

Federal jury decides Middle East bank did not defraud Orange County entrepreneur<http://fw.to/aXv1QHI> 
[Farooq Bajwa] 
Farooq Bajwa 
By Andrew Khouri 
August 11, 2016 
A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East's most prominent banks did not commit fraud and 
steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership 
collapsed. 
Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment 
system because it didn't want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan's technology to launch its own service. 
The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan's technology. It argued that it cancelled 
the partnership because InfoSpan couldn't produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an 
established company, not one with little to no track record. 
After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and 
theft of trade secrets. 
InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012041 
possibility of an appeal. 
The verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile attorneys 
on both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama. 
At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a 
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back 
home through text messages. 
Bajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the 
business and technology. 
To launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled 
by the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund. 
It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine 
company that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s 
The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-made 
market for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply than 
Western Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system. 
A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal's 
fifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees. 
But the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009. 
A few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they 
defrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology. 
Two years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was working 
and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to launch 
its own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan's technology. 
In court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it abhorred 
how much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm. 
"They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money," attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing 
arguments Wednesday. 
Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator 
David Boies — argued that the bank resorted to "pure extortion" in an attempt to get its way. 
As a result of the bank's criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa's partner, Larry Scudder, was detained at 
the Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours until 
he secured his release by turning over his passport. 
According to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told Scudder's passport would be 
released and he could leave the country only if InfoSpan gave up ownership and control of SpanCash to the 
bank. 
Six months later, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and Scudder got his passport back, but SpanCash's 
reputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The Times. 
The bank disputed that it acquired InfoSpan's source code or used it at any time. 
Former White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never would 
have acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such 
technology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership. 
In her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and 
InfoSpan sold the bank a "bill of goods," arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never 
worked and InfoSpan wasn't as big a company as it claimed. 
The bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the 
bank's money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan's employees, Ruemmler 
told the jury. 
"They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded," she said. 
Lubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that "Emirates 
Bank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts." 
Bajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn't know his next steps. 
"I am just beat up," he said.

I'm a reporter at CNN, and my colleague Blake Ellis and I have read that Bill Clinton and Donald 
Trump have both visited Epstein's private island. We are trying to determine whether there is any 
truth to the allegations that either or both of these men may have had sexual relations with minors 
while there. We know that you have been Epstein's pilot, so we're wondering if you would be willing 
to speak with us completely off the record. We are not focusing on the allegations against Epstein --
we are solely focusing on Trump and Clinton given the current allegations being levied in the press. 
If you don't feel comfortable sharing anything via social media or email, feel free to send us any

'Shady' Israeli Mogul Hires Ex-White House Counsel To Represent Employee Arrested in Inauguration Day 
Riot, Raising Questions<http://heatst.com/politics/shady-israeli-mogul-hires-ex-white-house-counsel-to-
represent-employee-arrested-in-inauguration-day-riot-raising-questions/> 
By Heat Street Staffl 6:36 pm, January 23, 2017 
The mystery surrounding a would-be media magnate — who owns surveillance and security firms working for 
repressive regimes — is growing. 
The questions about Matania (Mati) Kochavi were sparked again this weekend when Kathryn Ruemmler, who 
until recently was President Obama's White House Counsel, showed up on Saturday morning in local 
Washington DC court to represent one of the 217 people arrested for rioting on Inauguration Day. 
[http://heatst.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ruemmler-obamajpg?w=300]Kathryn Ruemmler and client. 
Ms. Ruemmler said she was there to represent a journalist, on assignment for the media company 
Vocativ<http://www.vocativ.com/>, who'd gotten swept up with the protesters in the arrests. 
Vocativ is owned by Kochavi. Reporters at the courthouse asked why a big gun like Ruemmler, who has long 
been a specialist in corporate crime, would show up for what would seem to be a misunderstanding involving a 
journalist doing his job. 
Ms. Ruemmler told Buzzfeed that Vocativ is a client of her 
firm,<http s ://www.buzz feed. co m/zo etillman/pro s ecutors-pursue-rioting- charges- over-inauguration- day-
pro?utm term=.gtPej4zonti.cgyzaBvG2> Latham & Watkins. The firm is one of the most prestigious law shops 
in New York and Washington with partners such as Ruemmler<https://www.lw.com/people/kathrynruemmler> 
charging thousands of dollars an hour. 
She did look somewhat out of place among the lawyers there to defend anarchists and other alleged 
troublemakers who are charged with rioting, burning a limo and smashing up stores on the streets of the capital. 
"The individuals charged were generally brought in front of the judge in groups of 10 and were represented by a 
cadre of public defenders and other court-appointed lawyers," according to Buzzfeed. That was not the case 
when it came to Vocativ. 
Based in New York and Tel Aviv, Vocativ publishes mostly reprints of health studies, aggregated videos for 
Facebook, and female focused feature pieces. The company which employs a large team of US journalists and 
ex-Israeli intelligence operatives, claims to use technology from the intelligence world to source its stories. 
Indeed its founder, Kochavi, has a background in Israeli intelligence, having made his fortune providing 
security and military grade public safety solutions to the superrich Emirate of Abu Dhabi through an entity 
called AGT. 
[http ://heatst. com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/abu-dhabi-mosque.jp g?w=300] The Grand Mosque of Abu 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026653 
Dhabi 
AGT was responsible for installing a "unique civil surveillance network in Abu Dhabi that means 'every person 
is monitored from the moment they leave their doorstep to the moment they return to it,' according to the noted 
security publication MiddleEastEye.<http ://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-israel-surveillance-2104952769> 
The invasive system is dubbed "Falcon Eye". 
Kochavi also owns Israeli security and private intelligence firms 3iMind and Logic Industries. Like Vocativ, 
3iMind claims to use "the deep web" to mine information, though in 3iMind's case it provides spy services, not 
journalistic ones. 3iMind even advertises online that it will spy on "the planning and execution of violent civil 
unrest" for clients.<https://www.3i-mind.com/use cases/political-social-unrest/> 
The website for Kochavi's mother company<https://www.agtinternational.com/about/>, AGT, claims its current 
business is using "Internet of Things" technology for entertainment and "fashion" applications in partnership 
with the giant talent agency WME-IMG ... though it's unclear what any of these applications really 
are<http://www.euroleague.net/final-four/berlin-2016/news/i/6vokoibj5fsgqg4q/heed-the-event-platform-based-
joint-venture-between-wme-img-and-agt-international-makes-first-official-foray-into-sports>, and certainly 
what value they provide for entertainment. Security experts say Internet of Things type sensors could be tied 
together to monitor crowds for security purposes. 
According to Israeli and U.S. Jewish publications, the lines within Kochavi's companies can blur, with Vocativ 
employees doing work for 3iMind and Logic, and vice versa. So who was this "journalist" arrested amid the 
unrest on Inauguration Day? Was he actually doing journalism? Or, as some journalists around town have been 
asking, could he also have been doing surveillance of anti-Trump demonstrators on behalf of an Arab or Israeli 
client, possibly a foreign government?

=300]Kochavi employee Evan Engel (LinkedIn) 
A call to Ruemmler was returned by someone identifying himself as a Vocativ spokesperson. He told Heat 
Street that the arrested employee, Evan Engel, was doing purely journalistic work at the time he was detained. 
"The arrest, detainment and rioting charge against journalist Evan Engel who was covering the protests for 
Vocativ are an affront to the First Amendment and journalistic freedom," the spokesperson said. "Vocativ will 
vigorously contest this unfounded and outrageous charge." 
Kochavi has taken pains to put a different face, unrelated to spying and surveillance, on his American activities. 
Vocativ acts like a news organization, though it's made little splash (and gets remarkably little web 
traffic<http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/vocativ.com>) for an operation so large and expensive. 
Kochavi has also shown little hesitation to pay top dollar for access to the most powerful figures in America to 
provide legitimacy for his American activities. Last fall's Wikipedia data dump revealed that he and his 
longtime business partner, New York rainmaking lawyer Mary Edelman, offered Bill Clinton millions of dollars 
to serve as honorary chairman of the company that would become Vocativ. <http://heatst.com/biz/wikileaks-
bill-clinton-turned-down-8-million-to-be-honorary-chairman-of-news-site-vocativ/> Clinton turned them down, 
perhaps nervous about Kochavi who's been described as "a mysterious even somewhat shady character" and the 
Israeli "version of the old-fashioned arms dealer with a suit and an MBA" by the progressive Jewish blog 
Tikkun Olam.<https://www.richardsilverstein.com/2014/12/04/israeli-cyber-security-merchant-peddles-wares-

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026654 
And now Kochavi has purchased the services of President Obama's former White House counsel, Ruemmler, 
whose name was once on the shortlist<http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ruemmler-attorney-general-nixed-
20141024-story.html> for US attorney general. It's a fair question to ask: why was Ruemmler really down in 
local DC court on a Saturday morning? Why was getting this Vocativ employee off the hook such a high 
priority? And what, if any, other services has Ruemmler, the corporate crime expert, been providing to Kochavi 
and his various intelligence operations around the world? 
Ruemmler herself has not returned requests for comment.

WASHINGTON — As hundreds of thousands of demonstrators 
gathered<https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeednews/womens-
march?utm term=.wra9MGEmBAgtOrQXPW34> on the National Mall to protest President Trump on 
Saturday, people arrested<https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/rioters-and-police-are-clash-during-trumps-
inauguration> the day before during anti-Trump protests in downtown Washington, DC, made their first 
appearance in court. 
Prosecutors are pursuing charges against all of the 230 people arrested on Friday for rioting, according to the 
US attorney's office in DC. Although anti-Trump demonstrations on inauguration day were largely peaceful, 
some turned violent, with participants breaking storefront windows, throwing bricks at police, and running 
through streets and parks downtown as they were chased by police. 
The arraignment hearing at DC Superior Court began on Saturday around 1 p.m. and was still going six hours 
later. As of 7 p.m., 80 people arrested and charged with felony rioting had come before a judge. The court was 
expected to continue the hearing through the night until everyone arrested on Friday came through. 
The defendants processed so far were released until their next court dates, with the condition that they not be 
arrested again in DC in the meantime. 
Felony rioting is a crime under DC law that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and a fine of up to 
$25,000. According to police, six officers were injured in confrontations with demonstrators on Jan. 20, and 
three of those officers sustained minor head injuries after objects were thrown at them. The DC law defines 
felony rioting as a group of at least five people who, "by tumultuous and violent conduct and the threat thereof," 
cause "serious bodily harm" or property damage valued at more than $5,000. 
A 21-year-old Texas man was also charged with pointing a laser at at US Park Police helicopter during the 
protests on Friday. He was arraigned in Superior Court but the case is being moved to federal court. 
The individuals charged with rioting were generally brought in front of the judge in groups of 10 and were 
represented by a cadre of public defenders and other court-appointed lawyers. One exception came early in the 
hearing, when former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler entered an appearance for one of the 
defendants. Ruemmler said her client was a journalist on assignment filming the demonstrations who was swept 
up in the arrests. 
Ruemmler served as President Obama's White House counsel for three years before going to the law firm 
Latham & Watkins. Ruemmler told reporters outside of the courtroom that her firm represents Vocativ, the 
media company that employed her client, which is how she got involved. 
Dozens of people came to the courthouse on Saturday to support the arrestees. They cheered as defendants left 
the courtroom; some of the defendants were walking slowly to keep their shoes on because they had to remove 
their shoelaces after being arrested. The defendants were held by police overnight.

Zoe Tillman / BuzzFeed News 
By Saturday night, a crowd had gathered outside the courthouse to greet the arrestees, cheering and applauding 
as they came out. A line of police formed in between the group and the courthouse entrance, and police were 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026656 
screening people trying to go inside. 
Several lawyers offered a preview of their defense strategy during the hearing, arguing that the rioting charge 
should be dismissed because prosecutors hadn't shown that each defendant was specifically involved in the 
rioting described in charging documents. Although the defendants were brought out in groups before the judge, 
they're individually charged. 
One lawyer argued that the US attorney's office should recuse from prosecuting the cases because the 
defendants were charged with participating in anti-Trump riots and Trump was now in charge of the US 
Department of Justice. 
"I appreciate all the creative arguments," Magistrate Judge Rainey Brandt said in response, but she said that at 
this early stage of the case she only had to find that the government had shown probable cause to move the 
cases forward. 
The defendants are due back in court on various dates in February and March.

Officials in the nation's capital are throwing the book at anti-Trump protesters —threatening the people who 
were arrested <http ://nyp o st. com/2017/01/20/dozens-arrested-as-anti-trump-protesters-clash-with-p o lice> with 
massive fines and up to 10 years in jail. 
The U.S. attorney's office will seek to charge all 230 of the protesters who took to the streets on Inauguration 
Day — some damaging storefronts and clashing with police — with felony rioting. 
As of Saturday evening, 80 people had already been slapped with the heavy charges, which include fines of up 
to $25,000 and up to 10 years in jail, according to 
Buzzfeed.<http s ://www.buzzfeed. com/z o etillman/pro secutors-pursue-rioting-charges-over-inaugurati on-day-

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026657 
Felony rioting is defined in D.C. law by at least five people who use "tumultuous and violent conduct of the 
threat thereof' to cause "serious bodily harm" and instigate more than $5,000 in property damage. 
Six local officers were injured by protesters during Trump's big day. The glass windows of several businesses 
were shattered in downtown D.C. including Bank of America, McDonald's and Starbucks. 
All of the people who have already been charged were released on their own recognizance and given their next 
court appearance dates.

When It Comes to Wall Street, Preet Bharara Is No 
Hero 
The prominent U.S. attorney fired by Donald Trump this weekend has 
been justly acclaimed for his pursuit of political corruption. But his 
treatment of the Wall Street executives involved in the financial meltdown 
was far less confrontational.

_____Preet Bharara, then U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, at Trump 
Tower in November 2016 (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) 
After his election in 1968, President Richard Nixon asked Robert Morgenthau, the US 
Attorney for the Southern District of New York, to resign. Morgenthau refused to leave 
voluntarily, saying it degraded the office to treat it as a patronage position. 
Nixon's move precipitated a political crisis. The president named a replacement. Powerful 
politicians lined up to support Morgenthau. Morgenthau had taken on mobsters and power 
brokers. He had repeatedly prosecuted Roy Cohn, the sleazy New York lawyer who had 
been Senator Joe McCarthy's right-hand man. (One of Cohn's clients and protégés was a 
young New York City real estate developer named Donald Trump.) When Cohn complained 
that Morgenthau had a vendetta against him, Morgenthau replied, "A man is not immune 
from prosecution merely because a United States Attorney happens not to like him." 
Morgenthau carried that confrontational attitude to the world of business. He pioneered the 
Southern District's approach to corporate crime. When his prosecutors took on corporate 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019845 
fraud, they did not reach settlements that called for fines, the current fashion these days. 
They filed criminal charges against the executives responsible. 
Before Morgenthau, the Department of Justice focused on two-bit corporate misdeeds 
Ponzi schemes and boiler room operations. Morgenthau changed that. His prosecutors went 
after CEOs and their enablers___the accountants and lawyers who abetted the frauds or 
looked the other way. "How do you justify prosecuting a nineteen-year old who sells drugs 
on a street corner when you say it's too complicated to go after the people who move the 
money?" he once asked. 
Morgenthau's years as United States Attorney were followed by political success. He was 
elected New York County District Attorney in 1974, the first of seven consecutive terms for 
that office. 
There are parallels between Morgenthau, and Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the 
Southern District who was fired by President Trump this weekend. 
Like Morgenthau, the 48-year old Bharara leaves the office of US Attorney for the Southern 
District celebrated for taking on corrupt and powerful politicians. Bharara prosecuted two of 
the infamous "three men in a room" who ran New York state: Sheldon Silver, the 
Democratic speaker of the assembly and Dean Skelos, the Republican Senate majority 
leader. 
He won convictions of a startling array of local politicians, carrying on the work of the 
Moreland Commission, an ethics inquiry created and then dismissed by New York's Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo. (This weekend, Bharara cryptically tweeted that "I know what the 
Moreland Commission must have felt like," a suggestion that he was fired as he was 
pursuing cases pointed at Trump or his allies.) 
But the record shows that Bharara was much less aggressive when it came to confronting 
Wall Street's misdeeds. 
President Obama appointed Bharara in 2009, amid the wreckage of the worst financial crisis 
since the Great Depression. He inherited ongoing investigations into the collapse, including 
a probe against Lehman Brothers. 
He also inherited something he and his young charges found more alluring: insider-trading 
cases against hedge fund managers. His office focused obsessively on those. At one point, 
the Southern District racked up a record of 85-0 in those cases. (Appeals courts would later 
throw out two prominent convictions, infuriating him and dealing blows to several other 
cases.) 
Hedge funds are safer targets. The firms aren't enmeshed in the global financial markets in 
the way that giant banks are. Insider trading cases are relatively easy to win and don't 
address systemic abuses that helped bring down the financial system. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019846 
Even there his record was more mixed than is popularly understood. As Sheelah Kolhatkar 
demonstrates in her propulsive and riveting "Black Edge," when it came to bringing his 
biggest whale to justice, Steve Cohen of SAC Capital, the Southern District blinked. They 
did not charge him, only securing a guilty plea from his firm. 
Present and former prosecutors say Bharara did not give much emphasis to investigations 
arising from the financial meltdown, an approach shared by his boss, Attorney General Eric 
Holder. Justice Department insiders say many of those inquiries withered not because they 
were unpromising, but because they had little support. 
Bharara missed an opportunity by not bringing any significant criminal charges against 
individuals in the wake of the collapses of Lehman, investment bank Merrill Lynch, the 
insurer AIG, the mortgage securities and collateralized debt obligation businesses, or the 
myriad public misrepresentations from bank CEOs about their finances. 
Bharara and senior officials in Washington argue that there were no criminal cases to file 
after the 2008 crisis. But the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan did pursue significant civil 
cases against the banks for their mortgage activities, cases that had to proove misconduct by 
the "preponderance of the evidence." And DOJ did win guilty pleas from the banks 
themselves, an indication that prosecutors might have been able to charge individuals for 
their part in crimes their institutions had acknowledged. Academics who studied those years, 
including Columbia's Tomasz Piskorski and James Witkin and Chicago's Amit Seru found  
widespread patterns of fraud in the mortgage business. 
The exception makes this failure all the more puzzling. As I detailed in 2014, Bharara's 
office brought one case for misconduct during the financial crisis____against a mid-level 
banker. Prosecutors charged Kareem Serageldin of Credit Suisse with overseeing traders 
who knowingly misrepresented the value of mortgage securities. Serageldin pleaded guilty 
and went to prison. 
Serageldin's colleagues in the industry and others familiar with Credit Suisse found it hard 
to believe that he was the only person involved in that particular fraud. 
Bharara's reluctance to pursue senior executives was seen in other investigations of big 
banks. His office wrested a $1.7 billion fine from JPMorgan Chase over its complicity in the 
Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, but it brought no charges against individual bankers. 
One odd aspect of his tenure was the Southern District's willingness to defer to other 
jurisdictions when it came to Wall Street cases. 
Historically, the SDNY has been the leading enforcers of securities laws, nicknamed the 
"sovereign district" for its propensity to grab corporate fraud cases from elsewhere on the 
flimsiest of jurisdictional pretexts. Under Bharara, the southern district let other U.S. 
attorneys claim investigations into residential mortgage-backed securities, the instruments at 
the heart of the financial crisis. Those other offices were not nearly as versed in complex 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019847 
financial cases as their colleagues in Manhattan. In addition, Bharara's office ceded post-
financial crisis investigations into foreign exchange and global interest rate manipulation to 
prosecutors working from the Justice Department's headquarters. 
Like Morgenthau, Bharara was a prominent figure in the New York landscape, given to 
well-orchestrated press conferences and memorable sound bites. Like Morgenthau, he did 
not leave office quietly, even thought the president has a longstanding right to name his own 
U.S. attorneys. And like Morgenthau, he may try to parlay his martyrdom into elective 
office. 
But if he runs on his record of convictions, as prosecutors often do, voters might want to 
consider as well the list of possible targets he never pursued.

Middle Eastern Monarchs Look at the 
Trumps and See Themselves 
America's Arab allies have always wanted to buy direct access 
to U.S. foreign policy, and they finally found a seller. 
May 28, 2018

medal at the Saudi Royal Court in Riyadh on May 20, 2017.(MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty 
Images) 
Almost 20 years ago when I was a graduate student living in Cairo, I published an article in 
a Washington-based journal called Middle East Insight. The magazine had a solid 
reputation, with a knack for scoring interviews with important people. (In the same edition 
as my piece, titled "Egypt's Next Generation," there was an interview with Gamal Mubarak, 
son of long-term Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who had already begun his rise___ 
though not yet his eventual fall____as heir apparent.) A few years later, Middle East Insight 
disappeared. When I heard the news, I figured the magazine was too niche for an expanding 
media environment, shrugged my shoulders, and went on with life. 
I hadn't thought about Middle East Insight until its onetime publisher, George Nader, 
recently exploded into the news as an international man of mystery at the center of an 
apparent attempt to covertly influence the outcome of the last American presidential 
election. It seems that in the span of not quite two decades, the guy who ran a small, likely 
not profitable, but influential policy magazine become a conduit between Crown Prince 
Mohammed bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi, Saudi Crown Prince 
Mohammed bin Salman, and Donald Trump's closest inner circle, both after, and 
crucially for special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing criminal investigation___before 
Trump's election as U.S. president. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029505 
Nader's story is yet another example of the sleaze, greed, and influence-peddling that has 
come to seem ordinary in Trump-era Washington. But it also offers a view into a more 
extraordinary and unprecedented problem: a decision by some of America's closest allies in 
the Middle East to leverage their financial resources in common cause with a bunch 
of ganef s to influence U.S. foreign policy. It is a problem that can be traced back, in ways 
that haven't generally been understood, to Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor Jared 
Kushner and his mobile phone. 
From the perspective of the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel (there 
is an Israeli angle to the George Nader story, but it isn't yet entirely clear), and Egypt, there 
was an entirely rational reason to support Trump's presidential bid and try to influence his 
approach to the Middle East: They did not like former President Barack Obama's Middle 
East policy. And while they likely understood that presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was 
more hawkish that the president she served as secretary of state, the Saudis, Emiratis, and 
Israelis were concerned that she would be tethered to the Iran nuclear deal and thus Obama's 
Iran policy. 
They also believed that Clinton would be soft on Islamists. It is an article of faith in Egypt 
that she enabled the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood and Mohamed Morsi in 2011 and 2012. 
For countries in the Persian Gulf, Egypt provides strategic depth, and "losing" it to the 
Muslim Brotherhood was a major geopolitical blow. The Israelis, for obvious reasons, were 
deeply concerned about the accumulation of Islamist political power next door and blamed 
the Obama administration for abandoning Hosni Mubarak, thereby placing Israel's security 
in jeopardy. 
With Trump, Washington's allies got a candidate and president who referred to the Iran 
nuclear agreement as the "worst deal ever," surrounded himself with people who either 
make no distinction between al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood or are simply outright 
Islamophobes, and has forthrightly declared that the United States supports its friends in the 
fight against terrorism. Full stop. No caveats, buts, or howevers concerning human rights 
and the need for political reform. To them, this seemed a lot better than the appreciation of 
nuance and complexity that was a hallmark of the Obama administration. 
Of course, even if an American president shares a given ally's view of the world, diplomacy 
does not stop. The job of ambassadors, foreign ministers, and other representatives of 
foreign governments is to keep the United States on their side. Traditionally, this is done 
through formal discussions with U.S. officials at the State Department, National Security 
Council, and Department of Defense; meetings with members of Congress; writing op-eds in 
influential media outlets; and informal channels of influence, notably the Washington social 
circuit of dinners, embassy garden parties, national day events and the like. No doubt there 
was a lot of this going on through the first year and half of the Trump administration. But as 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029506 
we now know, there was an entirely parallel effort to influence American foreign policy, and 
George Nader was at the center of it. 
According to the New York Times, Nader and Elliott Broidy pitched a scheme to the 
governments of the UAE and Saudi Arabia in which Broidy would use his extensive 
contacts in Washington, especially in the White House, to shape U.S. policy toward Qatar, 
which the Saudis and Emiratis accuse of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, funding 
extremism, and cozying up to Iran. Apparently, the Emiratis agreed to the arrangement. 
Clearly, putting the screws to Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani is a high priority for 
the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, who undoubtedly would not apologize 
for using every method and resource at their disposal to advance their countries' interests. 
What is the Trump administration's excuse, though? 
The kind of influence-peddling in which Nader and Broidy were involved can be traced back 
to Jared Kushner. On Nov. 8, 2016, if not before, he was handing out his cellphone number 
to all kinds of people in Washington with little regard for the potential consequences and 
apparently little idea about who was genuinely powerful and who were just posers. No doubt 
that important people in certain countries had the mobile numbers of senior members of the 
Obama administration, plus their Gmail addresses, but there was something qualitatively 
different about the way Kushner was operating. He was essentially opening the door to a 
Trumpian culture in which there is no process, there is no vetting, everyone and anyone 
could be an asset, loyalty is the greatest quality second only to money, and there are always 
ways to get something done no matter what. 
Trump's world does not operate the same way as Washington's major Middle Eastern allies, 
but there are some parallels that make stories like the George Nader affair possible. Trump's 
tendency to eschew the formal processes and procedures of government dovetails with the 
way in informal power, uncodified norms, and past practices shape governance and policy in 
places as diverse as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Israel. These kinds of informal 
institutions exist in the United States as well; a lot of things have gotten done in Washington 
over the years because of the Harvard "old boys' network or because that's the way it has 
always been done in the cloakroom. But informal networking has generally not guided the 
realm of foreign policy, which has always involved an exhaustive (and exhausting) 
interagency process. Kushner's willingness to hand out his digits signaled that Team Trump 
was open to doing things significantly differently from previous administrations, and U.S. 
allies along with people like Nader and Broidy took him up on it. The result was a $650 
million contract for Broidy's security firm after he bent the ear of the president and others 
about the perfidy of the Qatari leadership. 
From the vantage point of Middle Eastern capitals, in Trump's Washington, the secretary of 
state and the national security advisor are superfluous. You could go through Kushner or 
supplement by engaging in some "riyalpolitik." The influence business has been around 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029507 
Washington for a long time. The amount of money that foreign governments expend on D.C. 
lobbying is staggering, but the Nader-Broidy scheme was an attempt to sell American 
foreign policy___which, as Mueller will soon remind everyone lest anyone in Trump's orbit 
forget, is different from selling real estate.

Subject: Indicting a President Is Not Foreclosed: The Complex History - Lawfare

Indicting a President Is Not Foreclosed: The 
Complex History 
Can a sitting president be indicted? Often, in answering this question, commentators point to 
Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions answering in the contrary. To whatever extent the 
writer agrees or disagrees with the opinions' conclusion, the government's position on the 
matter is usually presented as a long-standing and clear "no." 
The reality is more complicated. The United States has addressed this question six times in 
both internal memos and briefs filed in litigation. And a review of these documents shows 
that it is far from clear what criminal prosecution steps are (or should be) precluded___and 
that there is no "longstanding policy" against indictment of the president. Consider the 1973 
OLC memo stating that a sitting president should not be indicted. Far from being 
authoritative, it was essentially repudiated within months by the Justice Department in the 
United States' filing in the Supreme Court in United States v. Nixon. 
Likewise, the most recent opinion___an OLC memo written in 2000___includes brief 
statements that a sitting president should not be indicted even if all further proceedings are 
postponed. But far from being definitive, this is a matter that could be reconsidered by the 
department. Moreover, of course, OLC opinions are not binding on state prosecutors (though 
state charges could raise federalism questions as well). The complex history of criminal 
proceedings against presidents and vice presidents suggests that these issues are not 
foreclosed. 
Perhaps the most important point that emerges from a review of all the opinions is this: nly 
once has the United States addressed the question of whether a president can be an 
unindicted co-conspirator. The conclusion was an unequivocal yes. Richard Nixon was so 
named in the Watergate indictment, and that inclusion was sustained by Judge John Sirica 
and defended by the United States in United States v. Nixon. (The Supreme Court did not 
resolve the question.) No department opinion or filing has ever contradicted that position. 
The fact that it is permissible to name a sitting president as unindicted co-conspirator, 
moreover, tends significantly to undermine the only argument against indicting a sitting 
president. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030200 
(I should note that the U.S. Attorney's manual cautions against naming persons as 
unindicted co-conspirators "[in the absence of some significant justification." Here, of 
course, the "significant justification" would exist if a sitting president is the only individual 
in the country who is immune from indictment. Thus, for that individual alone, the usual 
better course of indictment would not be available.) 
Here I want to review each of the half-dozen times that the executive branch has addressed 
the question of whether a president can be prosecuted, indicted or included as an unindicted 
co-conspirator. The opinions that conclude that a president cannot be indicted deal mainly 
with the question of whether a president can be put on trial. While the discussions of the 
option of indicting but postponing trial are more than a mere afterthought, that option was 
not the focus of the opinions and received scant analysis. 
The relevant briefs and memoranda are:

The Sept. 24, 1973, OLC Dixon memo

The June 21, 1974, reply brief for the United States in U.S. v. Nixon  
The May 13, 1998, memorandum to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
The Oct. 16, 2000, OLC memorandum  
These documents are worth review not only for their value as precedent but also for the 
extensive argumentation they contain on the pertinent issues. 
1. The Sept. 24, 1973, OLC Dixon Memo. This memo, signed by the head of the Office of 
Legal Counsel, Robert Dixon, is a procedural anomaly: It was not addressed to any official 
and may not have been made public at the time. It was not mentioned in the submission by 
the solicitor general two weeks later in the In re Agnew case. 
Dixon noted that there was no express provision of the Constitution conferring any 
immunity upon the president. The "proper approach" he wrote, "is to find the proper balance 
between the normal functions of the courts and the special responsibilities ... of the 
Presidency." He concluded that "criminal proceedings against a President in office should 
not go beyond a point where they could result in so serious a physical interference with the 
President's performance of his official duties that it would amount to an incapacitation." 
Thus, "a necessity to defend a criminal trial and to attend court ... would interfere with the 
President's unique official duties." 
Finally, Dixon addressed "a possibility not yet mentioned": that a sitting president could be 
indicted but further proceedings could be deferred until he was no longer in office. Unlike 
placing a president on trial, this would not result in a "physical interference" with the 
president's duties. Nevertheless, the memo concludes that this step should not be taken 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030201 
because of the reputational damage to the president: "The spectacle of an indicted President 
still trying to serve as Chief Executive boggles the imagination." 
Of particular interest is the memo's consideration of whether criminal proceedings against a 
vice president are precluded. OLC found this to be a difficult question before concluding 
that a grand jury could indict the vice president. The memo notes that Vice President Spiro 
Agnew was said to be part of a conspiracy and that it would be difficult to have a proper 
indictment of co-conspirators without including the vice president (a point also true of a 
conspiracy involving a president). Moreover, 
Another circumstance counselling prompt presentation of evidence to the grand jury is that 
the statute of limitations is about to bar prosecution of the alleged offenders with respect to 
some or all of the offenses. The problem presented by the statute of limitations would be 
avoided by an indictment within the statutorily specified period. 
(The issue of statute of limitations arises as well in cases involving a president.) 
The Dixon memo concludes that "[a]fter indictment, the question of whether the 
Government should ... delay prosecution until the expiration of the Vice President's duties 
involves questions of trial strategy" beyond OLC's expertise. 
The conclusion that the sitting president should not be indicted was not necessarily a 
categorical constitutional-judgment conclusion but seems, rather, to be a balance of policy 
considerations. That, it appears, is how it was read by the office of Special Prosecutor Leon 
Jaworski___as I will describe below. 
2. The Oct. 5, 1973, Brief for the United States in In re Agnew. Lawyers for Vice 
President Spiro T. Agnew argued that if a president could not be indicted while in office, 
that same immunity should apply to a serving vice president. The vice president should have 
the same immunity as the president, they wrote, because he "must maintain himself in a state 
of constant preparation to replace the president." And as the official with responsibility for 
initiating the 25th Amendment removal process, he must "continuously ... monitor the 
ability of the President" to discharge his duties. These responsibilities, they argued, were 
incompatible with being a defendant in a criminal case. Agnew's civil action, moreover, 
sought to enjoin the grand jury from even "conducting any investigation" into the allegations 
against Agnew as well as precluding "issuing any indictment." 
The United States, in a response filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by 
Solicitor General Robert Bork, opposed any immunity from criminal process for a vice 
president. The solicitor general did inform the court, however, that if the grand jury were to 
return an indictment, the Department of Justice "will hold the proceedings in abeyance for a 
reasonable time, if the Vice President consents to a delay, in order to offer the House of 
Representatives an opportunity to consider the desirability of impeachment proceedings." 
What was critical, according to Bork, was this: "The issuance of an indictment ... would in 
the meantime toll the statute of limitations and preserve the matter for subsequent judicial 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030202 
resolution." The memorandum concluded that while the demands of the presidency preclude 
subjecting the chief executive to criminal process, no such importance attaches to the office 
of the vice president. 
Because Agnew pleaded no contest to an indictment in a negotiated agreement, there was no 
resolution of his claim of immunity from indictment. Although the charges had been serious 
(Agnew was said to have accepted containers of cash in the White House), he was allowed 
to plead to a single count and serve no prison time, essentially in exchange for his 
resignation from the vice presidency___an outcome that may not have been possible had 
Agnew not been susceptible to indictment. 
3. The Feb. 12, 1974, Memorandum to Independent Counsel Leon Jaworski. The 
attorneys in the Office of Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski concluded that there 
was no legal bar to indicting a sitting president and that the office should recommend either 
that the grand jury indict President Nixon or that criminal charges against him be 
incorporated into a formal grand jury presentment. Jaworski concluded that the best course, 
with impeachment proceedings in the offing, was to include Nixon as an unindicted co-
conspirator in the indictment of the other Watergate defendants. 
The memo notes at the outset that 
As we understand it, the conclusions regarding indictment of an incumbent President 
reached by the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's office, and this office, are all 
consistent: there is nothing in the language or legislative history of the Constitution that 
bars indictment of a sitting president, but there are a number of 'policy' factors that weigh 
heavily against it. 
The memo finds those policy considerations offset by competing considerations. 
For us or the grand jury to shirk from an appropriate expression of our honest assessment of 
the evidence of the President's guilt would not only be a departure from our responsibilities 
but a dangerous precedent damaging to the rule of law. 
In deciding whether to indict a sitting president, they asserted, any considerations of a 
political nature should be left to Congress, which can decide if it wishes to immunize a 
president from prosecution. The special prosecutor's office did conclude, however, that the 
quantum of proof required to support an indictment of a sitting president should be quite 
high: "the evidence of the President's guilt should be direct, clear, and compelling and ... 
admit of no misinterpretation." 
Some of Jaworski '5 team thought that President Nixon should be indicted. Others favored 
proceeding by a "presentment," which would set out "in detail the most important evidence 
and the Grand Jury's conclusion that the President has violated certain criminal statutes and 
would have been indicted were he not President." The office concluded that "there appears 
to be no question of the propriety or legality of such a course...." The memo noted that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030203 
having the grand jury actually name the specific indictable crimes for which there was clear 
evidence of guilt was important: "This fundamental conclusion [of criminal guilt] should not 
be allowed to be lost in a recitation of facts or sources of evidence that omits the basic 
judgment involved or leaves it open to public (and Congressional) speculation and debate." 
The memo also noted that the president could be named an unindicted co-conspirator in the 
indictment of the other conspirators, the course ultimately chosen by Jaworski. 
4. The June 21, 1974, Reply Brief for the United States in US v. Nixon. The U.S. District 
Court for the District of Columbia refused Nixon's motion to expunge his inclusion as an 
unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate indictment. Nixon asked the Supreme Court to 
reverse that decision. His lawyers argued that since a sitting president could not be indicted, 
neither should he be implicated as an unindicted co-conspirator. 
In this filing on behalf of the United States, Jaworski rejected Nixon's premise that a 
president could not be indicted, stating that "It is an open and substantial question whether 
an incumbent President is subject to indictment." The brief argues for indictability before 
concluding that it is unnecessary to decide that question in order to resolve whether to permit 
his inclusion as an unindicted co-conspirator. 
(Despite the filing's origin in Jaworski's office, it would be a mistake to argue that this filing 
was not in some sense the position of the Department of Justice. Leon Jaworski and his 
attorneys were officers of the Department of Justice assigned by the attorney general the 
responsibility for advancing the legal positions of the United States, including in 
representations to the U.S. Supreme Court.) 
The Jaworski filing notes how critical it is to identify the president as one of the criminal 
accused: "the identification of each co-conspirator___regardless of station____is a 
prerequisite to making his declarations in furtherance of the conspiracy admissible against 
the other conspirators." 
Although the brief concludes that "it is by no means clear that a President is immune from 
indictment" during his term, the special prosecutor chose not to indict the sitting president 
on the basis of "practical arguments." Those arguments, however, 
cannot fairly be stretched to confer immunity on the President from being identified as an 
unindicted co-conspirator, when it is necessary to do so in connection with criminal 
proceedings against persons unquestionably liable to indictment. 
Naming the president as an unindicted co-conspirator was necessary for the grand jury to 
return a "true bill," Jaworski argued, and "required here to outline the full range of the 
alleged conspiracy." There exists, moreover, "a legitimate public purpose in reporting the 
fact that serious criminal charges against a government official have been made." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030204

The mere fact that an official has a personal immunity from prosecution does not bar the 
prosecution from alleging and proving his complicity as part of a case against persons who 
have no such immunity. 
It would not be fair "to the defendants ... to blunt the sweep of the evidence artificially by 
excluding one person, however prominent and important, while identifying all others." The 
Jaworski filing acknowledged that naming an incumbent president as an unindicted criminal 
co-conspirator may cause the public anguish of a cloud over the presidency. But "in the 
public marketplace of ideas" there is little reason to fear that malicious charges against a 
president "will receive credit they do not deserve." 
Notably, the United States made no mention of the OLC Dixon memo in its filing in the 
Supreme Court other than by implication: The filing says that the Department of Justice 
agrees that the Constitution does not bar indictment of a president, perhaps reading the 
Dixon OLC memo as merely a statement of policy. What is striking is that the 2000 OLC 
memo treats the 1973 Dixon memo as an important precedent but not the more substantial, 
more careful subsequent filing in the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Supreme Court did not answer Nixon's request to expunge his inclusion as an 
unindicted co-conspirator. Finding it unnecessary to answer that question in order to rule 
against the president on the subpoena of the nine tapes, the court dismissed Nixon's 
companion cert petition as improvidently granted. Nixon's resignation and pardon rendered 
the remaining questions moot. 
5. The May 13, 1998, Memorandum to Independent Counsel Starr. This memorandum 
was written by professor Ronald Rotunda in response to an inquiry from Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr. Rotunda concluded that 
In the circumstances of this case, President Clinton is subject to indictment and criminal 
prosecution, although it may be the case that he could not be imprisoned ... until after he 
leaves that office. 
The Rotunda memo is the least persuasive of the opinions in question. First, its status is 
unclear. It says that the question was posed by Starr, but it does not note whether Rotunda, 
who may have been a paid consultant, had any official governmental role. There is no 
indication that the opinion underwent any review by other officials. 
The opinion seems to claim too much, in my view, by suggesting that a president could be 
not only indicted but actually put on trial while serving. (Rotunda does not even rule out 
imprisoning a president.) There is an informal and partisan flavor to the memo that makes it 
less serious than the other arguments put forth by the department. 
Rotunda argues that the then-existing Independent Counsel Act contemplated that a 
president could be investigated and questioned, so therefore it must follow that he can be 
indicted. This is the obverse of the current argument made by some that since a president 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030205 
can't be indicted, he can't be questioned. Both positions are based on category mistake. No 
one has ever seriously suggested that a president can never be indicted. The only debate is 
whether any indictment of a president must be postponed until he is no longer in office. 
Since any president can indisputably be indicted when no longer in office, there is no 
permanent immunity that would obviate questioning of a president. 
6. The 2000 OLC Memorandum. This opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, signed by 
Assistant Attorney General Randolph Moss, is a thorough and thoughtful analysis of 
whether a president can be indicted and prosecuted while serving in office. It appears to 
have originally been drafted during the time of the Starr investigation of President Bill 
Clinton. The case against putting a president on trial is fully convincing to me. What is not 
so clear, however, is whether there is sound basis for withholding an indictment of a 
president even if any trial proceedings must await the end of his term. Like the Dixon memo, 
the 2000 opinion set out several obstacles to trying a president. None of those reasons, save 
one, applies to naming a president in an indictment. 
The 2000 opinion gives so little thought to the possibility of indicting-and-postponing that it 
gives only one reason why such a course should be precluded: the idea that including the 
president in an indictment would cast a "cloud" over the presidency. The notion that 
reputational harm alone should preclude a normal part of the system of justice seems 
incompatible with the Supreme Court's decision in Clinton v. Jones, in which the court set 
such a high bar for any presidential immunity from the normal process of litigation that not a 
single justice found that actually undergoing a civil trial was precluded. 
It is hard to square mere reputational harm as a basis for precluding indictment when the 
government seems to have established that a president can be listed as an unindicted co-
conspirator. The reputational difference between being named as an unindicted co-
conspirator in a criminal indictment and being listed as one of those indicted seems 
relatively small. The essential difference: naming one as indicted prevents the statute of 
limitations from expiring. Why, for a small reputational difference, would one choose to 
make being in the White House a basis for permanently precluding (by operation of the 
statute of limitations) an otherwise warranted criminal prosecution? 
One aspect of the 2000 memo is worth noting. It appears to have been drafted with the case 
against President Clinton in mind. That was essentially a one-defendant matter. Thus, the 
opinion does not grapple with the significant obstacles to trying a multi-defendant criminal 
conspiracy while excluding from the charging document any reference to one of the 
conspirators___and perhaps a key conspirator. 
For an extended argument that the terms of Robert Mueller's appointment and practice of 
the Office of Legal Counsel do not require him to conform to the 2000 OLC position 
opinion rejecting the option of indicting and postponing, see Andrew Crespo's analysis. In 
addition to Crespo's analysis, I would add that the 2000 memo gives only scant attention to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030206 
the possible course I believe deserves most consideration when a sitting president has been 
found to have committed a crime: indict-and-postpone. While I would not call the few 
mentions of that possibility "mere dicta," I believe the scant discussion of the point should 
not preclude an independent judgment by subsequent officials. The notion that such a course 
would cause reputational harm___though it would not physically interfere with the 
president's attention to his duties___seems to be a point of policy, not constitutional law. For 
a helpful analysis of this question, see Bob Bauer's posting. 
In any event, OLC has never suggested that a president cannot be an unindicted co-
conspirator. 
Conclusions 
The history of positions taken by the executive branch of the United States on the indictment 
of a sitting president is more varied and complex than is generally assumed. For that reason, 
whether or not a president can be indicted or named as an unindicted co-conspirator should 
not be considered a settled question. 
I am convinced that putting a president on trial would be inconsistent with the Article II 
responsibilities of the modern presidency. Others___Larry Tribe included___are less certain 
and also point to the 25th Amendment, arguing that if being on trial or incarcerated 
precluded a president from being able to perform his duties, the 25th Amendment provides a 
theoretical if impractical avenue for the vice president to take over in successive 21-day 
increments during that time. I see the point, but I believe that approach could too easily set 
aside the determination of the electorate. People vote for a president, not a vice president. It 
would be no small matter, for example, to have had Sarah PalM step in for John McCain. 
If a guilty president is not to be indicted, he or she should in any event be included in the 
charging instrument as an unindicted co-conspirator, an option that has been expressly 
defended by the United States before the Supreme Court. And once it has been established 
that a president can be an unindicted co-conspirator, the case for categorically precluding 
indictment of a president is significantly weakened. 
I have argued previously that there should be no categorical bar to the indictment of a sitting 
president. Clinton v. Jones establishes that a president has a substantial burden of showing 
that normal processes of litigation are incompatible with his duties___and while that showing 
can be made for an actual criminal trial, it is difficult to make such a showing for naming a 
president in a grand jury indictment as long as trial proceedings are postponed until a 
president is no longer in office. 
What, then, is the argument against indictment? Perhaps it casts a greater cloud. On the other 
hand, the most important reason for issuing an indictment, rather than merely naming the 
president as unindicted co-conspirator, is to prevent the statute of limitations from expiring. 
This, in my view, is an important consideration. Indeed, a president might seek reelection 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030207 
just to make sure the limitations period runs on all his or her crimes while he or she remains 
in office. 
But concluding that a president can be indicted does not mean that he or she should be 
indicted, even if that would be called for by the normal operation of the criminal process. 
Awaiting action by the House of Representatives may in some circumstances be the prudent 
course___though one might question whether it is appropriate to weigh that institutional 
factor variously depending on how realistic it is that a particular House and Senate would 
take their responsibilities seriously. 
Some offenses might be seen as better suited for initial consideration by Congress in the 
impeachment process. Whether an exercise of executive authority___such as discharging an 
official or pardoning someone for an allegedly corrupt reason___should be grounds for 
sanction might be seen as requiring an essential political judgment, perhaps best suited for 
elected officials to make. On the other hand, the regular processes of the federal criminal 
system might be a better forum for an alleged complex multi-defendant financial conspiracy 
including money laundering, bank fraud, tax evasion, etc. In short, context matters for a 
special counsel or other prosecutor considering how best to proceed. 
There is good reason to have the judiciary decide the question of whether an indictment of a 
sitting president is categorically barred. This is especially the case now that the decision 
process would in significant part be based upon an interpretation of a Supreme Court 
decision, Clinton v. Jones. If a prosecutor included the president in an indictment, the 
president would no doubt move to have his or her name stricken. The first question a judge 
should ask is, "If I strike the president from the indictment, will he or she agree to waive any 
defense of the statute of limitations that may expire while he or she is in office?" If the 
president refuses to waive the statute of limitations, that itself would be a good reason for 
permitting the indictment, while postponing any further proceedings. 
It is impossible to predict whether a prosecutor would ask the attorney general for 
authorization to indict____or to make the president an unindicted co-conspirator___without 
knowing the degree and nature of any criminality that might be uncovered, and how 
including or not including the president in an indictment would affect the trial of other 
conspirators. But the possibility of including the president in an indictment is not 
categorically foreclosed.

Mueller's Fruit of the Poisonous Tree 
It makes no difference how honorable he is. His investigation is tainted by the bias that 
attended its origin in 2016. 
By 
David B. Rivkin Jr. and 
Elizabeth Price Foley 
June 22, 2018 6:38 p.m. ET 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026484 
414 COMMENTS 
Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may face a serious legal obstacle: It is tainted by 
antecedent political bias. The June 14 report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's 
inspector general, unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking officials at the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. Some of their communications, the report says, were "not only indicative of a 
biased state of mind but imply a willingness to take action to impact a presidential candidate's electoral 
prospects." Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain whether this bias "directly 
affected" specific FBI actions in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, it nonetheless affects the 
legality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. 
Crossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its FBI progenitors—the same ones who 
had investigated Mrs. Clinton—deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign advisers, 
obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wiretap warrants, issued national security letters to 
gather records, and unmasked the identities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They also 
repeatedly leaked investigative information. 
Mr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn't expected to finish for months. But the 
current report reveals that FBI officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald 
Trump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Trump 
investigations, confidently assuaged a colleague's fear that Mr. Trump would become president: "No 
he won't. We'll stop it." An unnamed FBI lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was 
"devastated" and "numb" after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to another FBI attorney: "Viva le 
resistance." 
The report highlights the FBI's failure to act promptly upon discovering that Anthony Weiner's laptop 
contained thousands of Mrs. Clinton's emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the "higher 
priority" of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz writes: "We did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to 
prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on [the] investigative lead discovered on the 
Weiner laptop was free from bias." 
Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey was trying 
to influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the 
inspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was motivated 
by a desire to protect her assumed presidency's legitimacy. 
The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text messages "created the appearance that investigative 
decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations." The report adds, importantly, that "most 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026485 
of the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation." Given how biases 
ineluctably shape behavior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton 
investigation and building a narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials 
sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton's electoral chances and, if the unthinkable happened, obtain an insurance 
policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of illegitimacy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May 2017 after President Trump 
fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general concludes that the pervasive bias "cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned," including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was 
politically motivated, then its culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All 
special-counsel activities—investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and 
convictions—are fruit of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due process. That Mr. Mueller 
and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin offers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or property, it is required to use fundamentally 
fair processes. The Supreme Court has made clear that when governmental action "shocks the 
conscience," it violates due process. Such conduct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that 
appear, under the totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entrapment. 
In U.S. v. Russell (1973), the justices observed: "We may someday be presented with a situation in 
which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would 
absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction." It didn't take 
long. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), the court concluded that due process was offended by a 
prosecutor's "realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness' " that tainted the "very initiation of proceedings." 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton (1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have "power to 
employ the full machinery of the state in scrutinizing any given individual. . . we must have assurance 
that those who would wield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibility for 
the attainment of justice." Prosecutors must be "disinterested" and make "dispassionate assessments," 
free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias violated due 
process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earlier, in prosecuting the death-row inmate 
whose habeas corpus petition he was hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not 
vitiate the taint but heighten "the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might 
otherwise be obscured," the justices wrote. A single biased individual "might still have an influence 
that, while not so visible . . . is nevertheless significant." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026486 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the inspector general, there is a strong 
circumstantial case—including personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire 
was initiated for political, not national-security, purposes. 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department presumption against investigating 
campaigns in an election year. And while impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-
Attorney General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is "particularly important in an election 
year," and "politics must play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investigators regarding 
any investigations. . . . Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of 
investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of 
giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party." 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the case with the bureau's investigation of 
Mrs. Clinton's private email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But 
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence investigation predicated on the 
notion that Russia could be colluding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no 
discernible evidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing 
the notion that it was initiated "for the purpose" of affecting the presidential election. 
The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers. But 
nothing in the public record suggests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative 
therefore hinges on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump's election, and that 
the Trump campaign reciprocated by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance 
and investigation, there's still no public evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to 
sow political discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump. 
Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advocated dovish policies. But so did 
numerous American political and academic elites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential 
campaigns routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign powers. The Clinton campaign 
funded the Steele dossier, whose British author paid Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta 
Group, led by the brother of Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for 
Russia's largest bank and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties. The 
Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses. 
No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured 
to London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026487 
dinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he'd heard about such dirt but never seen it. These 
circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment. 
The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr. 
Papadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between 
the DNC hack and the Trump campaign. 
Crossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs. 
Clinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If 
anything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by 
dangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it. 
Given the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence 
investigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and 
subsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates 
were Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he 
could protect his campaign and the country. 
Mr. Trump's critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not 
leaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the 
Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire's launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr. 
Comey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons embarked 
on a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington. 
On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader 
Harry Reid, saying he'd learned of "evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government 
and Donald Trump's presidential campaign," which had "employed a number of individuals with 
significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin." On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic 
members of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting "that the FBI assess 
whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests" may have contributed 
to the DNC hack so as "to interfere with the U.S. presidential election." On Sept. 23, Yahoo News's 
Michael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier's allegations regarding Carter Page. 
On Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: "In my communications with you and other 
top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive 
information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian 
government." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026488 
That these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump's victory, or that Mr. Comey's ham-fisted 
interventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton's electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal 
significance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials. 
The totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since 
an attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election "shocks the conscience," any 
prosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The public 
will learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire's genesis. But given 
what is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel's activity be paused. 
Those affected by Mr. Mueller's investigation could litigate such an argument in court. One would 
hope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General Rod 
Rosenstein would do it first.

Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may face a serious legal obstacle: It is tainted by 
antecedent political bias. The June 14 report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's 
inspector general, unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking officials at the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. Some of their communications, the report says, were "not only indicative of a 
biased state of mind but imply a willingness to take action to impact a presidential candidate's electoral 
prospects." Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain whether this bias "directly 
affected" specific FBI actions in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, it nonetheless affects the 
legality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. 
Crossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its FBI progenitors—the same ones who 
had investigated Mrs. Clinton—deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign advisers, 
obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wiretap warrants, issued national security letters to 
gather records, and unmasked the identities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They also 
repeatedly leaked investigative information. 
Mr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn't expected to finish for months. But the 
current report reveals that FBI officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald 
Trump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Trump 
investigations, confidently assuaged a colleague's fear that Mr. Trump would become president: "No 
he won't. We'll stop it." An unnamed FBI lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was 
"devastated" and "numb" after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to another FBI attorney: "Viva le 
resistance." 
The report highlights the FBI's failure to act promptly upon discovering that Anthony Weiner's laptop 
contained thousands of Mrs. Clinton's emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the "higher 
priority" of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz writes: "We did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to 
prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on [the] investigative lead discovered on the 
Weiner laptop was free from bias." 
Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey was trying 
to influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the 
inspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was motivated 
by a desire to protect her assumed presidency's legitimacy. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026281 
The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text messages "created the appearance that investigative 
decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations." The report adds, importantly, that "most 
of the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation." Given how biases 
ineluctably shape behavior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton 
investigation and building a narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials 
sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton's electoral chances and, if the unthinkable happened, obtain an insurance 
policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of illegitimacy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May 2017 after President Trump 
fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general concludes that the pervasive bias "cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned," including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was 
politically motivated, then its culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All 
special-counsel activities—investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and 
convictions—are fruit of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due process. That Mr. Mueller 
and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin offers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or property, it is required to use fundamentally 
fair processes. The Supreme Court has made clear that when governmental action "shocks the 
conscience," it violates due process. Such conduct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that 
appear, under the totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entrapment. 
In U.S. v. Russell (1973), the justices observed: "We may someday be presented with a situation in 
which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would 
absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction." It didn't take 
long. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), the court concluded that due process was offended by a 
prosecutor's "realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness' " that tainted the "very initiation of proceedings." 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton (1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have "power to 
employ the full machinery of the state in scrutinizing any given individual. . . we must have assurance 
that those who would wield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibility for 
the attainment of justice." Prosecutors must be "disinterested" and make "dispassionate assessments," 
free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias violated due 
process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earlier, in prosecuting the death-row inmate 
whose habeas corpus petition he was hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not 
vitiate the taint but heighten "the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026282 
otherwise be obscured," the justices wrote. A single biased individual "might still have an influence 
that, while not so visible . . . is nevertheless significant." 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the inspector general, there is a strong 
circumstantial case—including personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire 
was initiated for political, not national-security, purposes. 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department presumption against investigating 
campaigns in an election year. And while impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-
Attorney General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is "particularly important in an election 
year," and "politics must play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investigators regarding 
any investigations. . . . Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of 
investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of 
giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party." 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the case with the bureau's investigation of 
Mrs. Clinton's private email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But 
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence investigation predicated on the 
notion that Russia could be colluding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no 
discernible evidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing 
the notion that it was initiated "for the purpose" of affecting the presidential election. 
The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers. But 
nothing in the public record suggests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative 
therefore hinges on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump's election, and that 
the Trump campaign reciprocated by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance 
and investigation, there's still no public evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to 
sow political discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump. 
Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advocated dovish policies. But so did 
numerous American political and academic elites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential 
campaigns routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign powers. The Clinton campaign 
funded the Steele dossier, whose British author paid Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta 
Group, led by the brother of Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for 
Russia's largest bank and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties. The 
Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026283 
No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured 
to London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to 
dinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he'd heard about such dirt but never seen it. These 
circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment. 
The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr. 
Papadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between 
the DNC hack and the Trump campaign. 
Crossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs. 
Clinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If 
anything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by 
dangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it. 
Given the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence 
investigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and 
subsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates 
were Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he 
could protect his campaign and the country. 
Mr. Trump's critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not 
leaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the 
Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire's launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr. 
Comey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons embarked 
on a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington. 
On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader 
Harry Reid, saying he'd learned of "evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government 
and Donald Trump's presidential campaign," which had "employed a number of individuals with 
significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin." On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic 
members of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting "that the FBI assess 
whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests" may have contributed 
to the DNC hack so as "to interfere with the U.S. presidential election." On Sept. 23, Yahoo News's 
Michael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier's allegations regarding Carter Page. 
On Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: "In my communications with you and other 
top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026284 
information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian 
government." 
That these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump's victory, or that Mr. Comey's ham-fisted 
interventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton's electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal 
significance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials. 
The totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since 
an attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election "shocks the conscience," any 
prosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The public 
will learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire's genesis. But given 
what is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel's activity be paused. 
Those affected by Mr. Mueller's investigation could litigate such an argument in court. One would 
hope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General Rod 
Rosenstein would do it first.

This drives me Ping crazy. 
Simple question for your boy: Did Donald Trump actively promote the theory that Barak Obama was not born 
in the US and was therefore not a legitimate President? 
Answer: Yes. 
He should not defend that shit. He can defend populist/nationalism all he wants, but when he bullies people 
defending obvious Trump lies, he loses credibility.

A former employee has told us that Donald Trump attended Mr Epstein's Palm Beach estate on at least two occasions. Does Mr 
Epstein recall hosting Donald Trump at that residence? 
On one such occasion, it has been suggested to us that Mr Epstein and Donald Trump watched "young girls try on bikinis" while 
making comments on the their bodies." Does Mr Epstein have any comment? 
How does Mr Epstein respond to claims that women - some under the legal age of sexual consent - were used as "sex slaves" at his 
properties? 
A former employee of Mr Epstein has alleged to us that Mr Epstein sexually assaulted her on 
numerous occasions. Does Mr Epstein have a comment? 
Did or does Mr Epstein have cameras inside rooms at his Palm Beach residence? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022819 
Did Mr Epstein remove those cameras before police raided the property as part of the investigation into alleged crimes? Did Mr 
Epstein ever hand over any recordings from any cameras at his properties to the authorities as part of his non-prosecution 
agreement? 
Does Mr Epstein have in his possession any video recordings of Donald Trump taken from inside his Palm Beach estate or any other 
residence? 
Did Mr Epstein hold sex parties at his residences involving girls under the age of sexual consent? Was Donald Trump ever present at 
any of these parties? 
Has Mr Epstein upheld the conditions of his sentencing and registered as a sex offender in all jurisdictions in which he is due to do so? 
Does Mr Epstein have any comment regarding allegations made by a woman named in the media aMI-elating 
to her being sexually abused by Mr Epstein or used as a "sex slave"?

Slowing economy could increase pressure on 
Big Tech 
Sara Fischer, David McCabe, Courtenay Brown5 hours ago 
A potential recession, combined with increasing regulatory threats for some of the biggest 
tech companies, foreshadows a difficult 2019 for Silicon Valley. 
Why it matters: The biggest tech companies have already raked in billions of dollars in 
profits and benefited from major tax cuts that aren't going to be repeated, so next year isn't 
likely to be better for them financially. They've also been dogged by scandals that have left 
many questioning their positive role in society, and if on top of that the economy starts to 
slip, 2019 could be worse. 
"People look for scapegoats in a bad economy. And with big tech already on its heels, a 
downturn probably would feed arguments that the largest internet companies are too big 
and need to be reined in." 
— Paul Gallant, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group 
Big Tech is closing out a contentious year in Washington, and potential regulation will 
continue to haunt it well into 2019. 
• Google CEO Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before Congress, and will likely be 
asked about whether the company is being transparent about its data privacy practices and 
any potential bias. By the year's end, the CEOs of Twitter, Google and Facebook will have 
been called to testified in front of Congress for the first time ever during 2018. 
• Lawmakers in the United States are pushing for a federal privacy law with an urgency 
likely to be exacerbated by more breaches like the one Marriott disclosed last Friday. 
• The Federal Trade Commission still has an open investigation into whether 
Facebook's conduct violated a previous settlement with the agency. Margrethe Vestager, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033420 
Europe's aggressive commissioner overseeing competition, is still investigating aspects of 
Google's business and whether Amazon plays fair in the market for generic products. 
• President Trump has said his administration is seriously looking into monopolistic 
behavior of Facebook, Google and Amazon. 
Some analysts predict an economic slowdown___even if it doesn't lead to a recession like 
the one in 2008___will be enough to change the global attitude around big American 
companies. 
"So the really shocking thing this year is that the only major economy in the world where 
growth has actually accelerated this year is America. And this is because of the tax cuts, the 
deregulation, the other stimulus which has been put into work. And that has also helped the 
earnings of companies. My point is, from next year onwards, those effects begin to fade." 
— Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley on Fareed Zakaria GPS  
on Sunday 
The "FAANG" stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) that pushed the 
stock market to record highs have not been immune from this year's market rout. 
• "The mood has changed. Investors are asking a lot more questions right now," says 
Larry Glazer, a Managing Partner at Mayflower Advisors, which manages $3 billion. 
"Momentum has faded on these names." 
• Adding to potential concern: possible regulatory action could translate into higher 
costs, particularly for Google or Facebook. 
• "Facebook has been under such a dark cloud for so long that now everybody is 
expecting the worst," Paul Meeks, a technology portfolio manager at Wireless Fund, told 
Amos. 
The other side: "I don't see a looming recession. And even if there was, people aren't going 
to target these companies if there is a recession," says Nicholas Economides, Professor of 
Economics at NYU Stem School of Business. 
• Economides argues that, even if there was a mild reduction in GDP growth, it 
wouldn't significantly impact the high tech sector. 
• For companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, "their main revenue streams are 
from ads. They gain market share from brands converting traditional ad spend to digital ads. 
This conversion is not so dependent on the growth of GDP, because they are still in the 
process of converting ads of different formats to digital ads, and that's something that will 
continue, regardless of GDP growth." 
The bottom line: Tech companies that have long been the darlings of investor portfolios 
will likely find themselves in much weaker positions.
