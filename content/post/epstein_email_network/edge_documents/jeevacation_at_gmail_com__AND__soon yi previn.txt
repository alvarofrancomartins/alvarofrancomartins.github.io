When I was 8 years old, I watched my trial-lawyer father play Horace Vandergelder in the Livingston, N.J., 
community-theater production of "Hello, Dolly!" He entered wearing an enormous marching-band bass drum 
(the character is in a parade), and he roared to his sobbing niece, "Dammit! How am I supposed to play 
'Yonkers My Yonkers' with all that bellowing in my ears!" It was the most exciting thing I had ever seen. 
I was a melancholic child. Worried, anxious. I never felt as if I belonged anywhere, as if I were a foreign 
exchange student living among the other kids, who seemed predestined to love sports. Add to that alienation the 
fact that my parents were going through a divorce, and I was truly treading water. But in that junior high school 
auditorium, I felt like I'd discovered a secret I didn't even know was being whispered. There was a place where 
I might belong: It was the Theater, and I was sold. 
A few years later, at Stagedoor Manor in Loch Sheldrake, N.Y., I joined an intensive theater boot camp for kids 
just like me. The second I stepped off the bus, I felt like baby Simba when he's lifted into the air in "The Lion 
King" and all the animals sing. Everyone was affectionate; everyone hugged; no was called "gay" for doing 
anything that wasn't masculine. (My insecurity about this had shamefully kept me from doing theater in 
school.) It was utopia, and I never wanted to leave.

It was there I met Michael Larsen, the musical director of the camp. He told me that I wasn't just a camper 
having fun, but that I also had talent. And he was tough — sometimes he'd scream at me — but I knew it was 
because he thought I had a shot. (Michael was the first of many gay men instrumental in guiding me to where I 
am now, which is why I try to speak on behalf of gay rights whenever I can. But I suppose that's a different 
essay.) 
At 18, I was cast as Woody Allen and Diane Keaton's son in the film "Manhattan Murder Mystery," my first 
movie role. And now, after studying film and theater at Northwestern University, playing J. D. on "Scrubs" on 
TV for nine years and directing two films, I'm working with Woody Allen again. I'm typing these words in my 
dressing room at the St. James Theater, where on April 10 I'll open in "Bullets Over Broadway," a musical 
adaptation of his hit film. I play David Shayne, a struggling writer in 1929 New York who agrees to cast a 
mobster's ditsy girlfriend in one of his plays in order to get it produced. 
The St. James is where Yul Brynner opened in "The King and I" in 1951; where hits like "Oklahoma!," "The 
Pajama Game," "Gypsy," "The Who's Tommy," and "The Producers" played, and where, in 1964, by the most 
surreal of coincidences, Carol Channing first descended an endless staircase in "Hello, Dolly!" I sit in Dressing 
Room 201, where many of the great luminaries of the Broadway stage — Patti LuPone, Nathan Lane, Mandy 
Patinkin — have paced waiting for the intercom to chime, "Places for Act I, please." This is the sanctuary that a 
little invisible boy in New Jersey dreamed he'd one day find.

It's my first time on Broadway, but not my first time onstage. My first job straight out of college was in George 
C. Wolfe's production of "Macbeth" at the Public Theater, starring Alec Baldwin, Liev Schreiber, Angela 
Bassett and Michael C. Hall, and I've since appeared Off Broadway in shows at the Delacorte and Second Stage 
Theater.

The first day of rehearsal for "Macbeth," Alec Baldwin sat down next to me. "Who do you play?" he asked. My 
voice quivered: "Ummm, I play Fleance and Young Seward." He paused. "Oh — so I kill you twice." Each 
night, as he drove his broadsword through my heart, I thought, "I've made it!" 
In the sixth season of "Scrubs," the show's creator, Bill Lawrence (also a major fan of musical comedy), 
decided to do a musical episode. It was the first time I had done musical comedy since I was at camp, and it 
instantly reminded me how much I loved it. My favorite song from the episode was called "Guy Love." In it, 
Donald Faison (my best friend in real life and on the show) and I sang about how our homoerotic love for each 
other was nothing to apologize for. ("It's guy love, that's all it is.") The experience replanted the seed, and I 
made a promise to myself: One day I would sing on Broadway.

I'd be curled in the fetal position spooning a pillow right now, though, if it weren't for my current director, 
Susan Stroman. Directing and choreographing a musical is the most epic undertaking for one human being, yet 
Susan (or Stro, as the cool Broadway kids call her) handles it with aplomb. 
And she's not just choreographing the actors and dancers, but also the magnificent set designed by Santo 
Loquasto, which moves in ways I didn't know scenery could move. It's a dance of men and women and 
machines and winches and elevators and lights. The wings of the St. James are very narrow, so when a giant 
piece of scenery disappears from the audience's view, the most elaborate game of Tetris begins, as the 
outstanding stage crew turns and lifts and twists; not an inch is wasted. The second the orchestra strikes the first 
note of the overture, no one stops moving until the final curtain hits the deck. 
During "Manhattan Murder Mystery," I had every word of my lines memorized down to the punctuation mark. 
I'll never forget: The first thing Woody said to me was, "We're probably not going to say exactly what's on the 
page so ... you know ... just try to keep up. ..." While we've been in previews on "Bullets," he and Stro have 
been giving us notes each day on the previous night's performance. One night, I dropped a great joke by 
accident. He said to me with a smile, "You'll probably get a bigger laugh if you actually say it onstage." 
All the people on Broadway are the best at what they do. All dancers want to work with Stro, so she gets the 
best dancers in New York City. Is there an oboist in the orchestra? You can guarantee he's the best oboist on the 
island of Manhattan. Need to recreate the look of 1929? The six-time Tony winner William Ivey Long is here to 
design the costumes. And the voices! I am in awe. There has yet to be a time when I don't get goose bumps 
when Betsy Wolfe, who plays my girlfriend, belts out the final notes of our duet, "I Found a New Baby." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028525 
In TV and film, where I've had the bulk of my experience, the best moments of the day are edited together to 
create the best version of what you've captured. It's a different art, with a different process. But when the 
curtain rises at 8:05 every night at the St. James, the audience is being treated to a ballet of moving parts as 
intricate as a pocket watch. Whether it's the 19-piece orchestra under the stage, the crew in the wings or the 30 
performers on top of it, the gears turn, the set spins and a tiny hidden smile creeps across my face. 
Zach Braff is an actor, writer and director. His new film, "Wish I Was Here," opens July 18.

Dear Jeffrey,

My name is Leah Reis-Dennis, and I'll be heading operations for Lisa's new non-profit, Verse Video Education. 
She's asked me to be in touch with you about helping us get a release from Woody Allen. 
First, I wanted to send along the rough stringout of footage from the conversation with Woody a couple of years 
ago on "This is Just to Say" by William Carlos Williams. This is totally unedited and uncut footage, but we 
would love the opportunity to turn it into something great. 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cObnljj xeo0654g/uWZ6KBVbLS?preview=WoodyAllen+Basic+Clip+for+Viewing.mov  
If Woody Allen agrees to let us use the footage, he will be in distinguished company. To date, we have filmed 
conversations about poetry with dozens of distinguished Americans including: 
Bill Clinton 
Al Gore 
John McCain 
Mayor Rahm Emanuel 
Mayor Tom Menino 
Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan 
Sir Mervyn King 
Former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers 
The conversation would be part of a large multiplatform initiative that Harvard Professor Lisa New has under 
way to bring poetry into the mainstream, and, especially, into English Language Arts classrooms in the United 
States and around the world. The initiative, Poetry in America, includes a HarvardX online course, a television 
series we're creating with WGBH to be paired with PBS LearningMedia segments for the classroom, and, a 
series of online professional development courses we're creating for ELA Middle and High School teachers and 
for their students. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029839 
Let us know if Woody Allen might be open to our sending another release form his way. Of course, if he's 
interested in releasing the footage for only certain parts of our project, we're open to having a conversation 
about that, too. 
Thank you, and I hope to meet you soon. 
Best, Leah

Dear Jeffrey, 
Woody has received from his lawyer some questions I asked in in response to the agreement Irwin Tenenbaum 
sent me... .1 found that that agreement generous and reasonable (!), and I'm excited to go forward, but I do need 
those clarifications. We can absolutely agree that we will not give Woody larger or more important billing than 
Bill Clinton or Joe Biden, and that I'd like to come to him to renew our agreement after five years. 
The Harvard week of content in which Woody will appear, if we can sign this, needs to be edited in the next 
week-10 days. We are out of time, which is why I'm writing 
The television show has been picked up by American Public Television, they will distribute nationally, and 
they've asked for another 5 episodes. I so want Woody to be one of those. 
I'd like to see the haiku written by computer. Haiku is not that hard. I'd like to see an elegy written by 
computer.
