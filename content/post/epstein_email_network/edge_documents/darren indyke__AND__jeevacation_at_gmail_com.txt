Details of the disturbing lifestyle led by Jeffrey Epstein emerged last night after the Daily 
Mail uncovered logs of telephone messages left at his Florida child sex den. 
Schoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages 
for the 58-year-old billionaire friend of Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex 
offences. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, is 
named in several messages. 
In one left for her or 'Sarah', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come 
this night for the massage'. Other messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, 
contain such phrases as: 'She has females for Mr JE' and 'I have a female for him'. 
Another with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just 
did a good one — 18 years. (She spoke to me and said, "I love Jeffrey")'. 
The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends 
including the business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and 
magician David Copperfield, referred to as 'Magic David'. 
The sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein's massages, many of 
which were 'erotic' and allegedly involved the abused girls. 
The evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into 
Epstein and seen yesterday by the Mail.

Message from a child asking what time to leave school 
---n-----e-__ 
Miss Maxwell is asked when a girl should give a massage 
One message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in 
school.' 
It was left in February 2005 — the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted 
police to Epstein's abuse. 
Another note shows that 'Colleen' phoned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class — will be out in 
45 mm.' 
Last night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers 
are included in the logs. 
One girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about 
Epstein. 
A man listed only as Darren said: 'I have no comment to make on that.'

claims. 
Ms further has stated to us that she intends to testify that she was flown to London by Mr Epstein and 
instructed to have sex at age 17 with Prince Andrew. She alleges that she was paid $15k for this encounter. 
She claims that on another occasion, Mr Epstein flew two young women to a dinner for the purpose of

New Book Rips Jeffrey Epstein's $50 Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme Text 
Hot Book Rips Jeffrey Epstein's $50 Billion Dollar Ponzi Crime Covered Up By President Obama 
By Steven Hoffenberg 
Publisher/CEO 
Lisa Twardeau died at the dirty hands of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's lies about the crimes he committed while working 
atTowersinvestors.com. 
Jeffrey Epstein looted Towers Investors of billions of dollars in ponzi crimes at the time Lisa became the wife of Steven Hoffenberg, 
who was Epstein's boss at Towers Investors. 
Epstein defrauded the Towers Investors with a cover-up after taking $2 billion from Towers and depositing it into the Epstein Hedge 
Fund Financial Trust Corp. 
Lisa Twardeau died when she was going to expose the fact that Jeffrey Epstein looted billions from Towers Investors by ponzi 
crimes. 
Now, from the grave, Lisa Twardeau slams arrogant ponzi crimes King Epstein in the tell-all book she wrote that reveals everything 
about Epstein and the Feds' cover-up with President Obama. 
The Feds are bad. They are covering up the Epstein ponzi crimes. The Lisa Twardeau book states that the FBI is violating the law 
with this cover-up. 
The book says President Obama told the Attorney General that Jeffrey Epstein was cooperating in an overseas banking crime, but 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031193 
the FBI can't arrest Epstein. These are all lies by the President of the United States. 
The book says that President Obama lied to cover up his relationship with Larry Summers who is on Jeffrey Epstein's payroll. 
The book could give reasons for the president to be impeached for obstruction of justice whereby the U.S. Attorney General will 
learn everything that is in the Twardeau book. 
Readers, stay with this hot story that reveals that a cover-up in America is taking place. 
The Richard Nixon story all over again is in the Lisa Twardeau book coming soon........

Hi, Michael. 
I'm writing about the Jane Doe case in SDNY involving Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Can I talk to you briefly? Story is likely going 
online in the next couple hours. Apologies for the short notice. I wanted to get a comment on behalf of Mr. Epstein. 
Thanks and best,

Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or 
anything of the kind. 
All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their 
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already 
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect in 
person. 
The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source. 
Once again, not sure was drifted away from this in communication

Thanks Darren 
Good news! 
I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will 
use mostly wires. 
Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends I would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when I need to. 
When I use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in 
multiple currencies, but I am not familiar with DB. 
Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed. 
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, I will also need to have 
someone keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be 
need for some work on my side before final filing is done. 
On the other hand, if there is a "checks and balances" control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers 
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. 
Please do let me know. 
We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032480 
In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.

Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or 
anything of the kind. 
All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their 
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already 
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect in 
person. 
The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source. 
Once again, not sure was drifted away from this in communication

Thanks Darren 
Good news! 
I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will 
use mostly wires. 
Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends I would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when I need to. 
When I use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in 
multiple currencies, but I am not familiar with DB. 
Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed. 
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, I will also need to have 
someone keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be 
need for some work on my side before final filing is done. 
On the other hand, if there is a "checks and balances" control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers 
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. 
Please do let me know. 
We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time) 
In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.

Search for next FBI director moves ahead quickly 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions interviewed eight candidates to replace fired FBI Director James 
Comey on Saturday, with President Donald Trump indicating that the nomination could be announced 
by Friday when he leaves for his first foreign trip. Potential replacements include FBI special agent 
Adam Lee, Judge Michael Garcia and former Justice Department employee Alice Fisher, who would 
be the first female director.

THE BUSINESS & POLITICS POLL 
What's your take on the Comey firing? 
President Donald Trump's sudden firing of FBI Director James Comey has stirred a flurry of calls for 
an independent investigation of the event and the FBI's probe into possible collusion between Trump's 
campaign and Russian officials. Critics say the president's action was a deliberate attempt to derail in 
FBI investigation, while defenders say the president acted properly and Comey deserved to be 
fired.This week's question: What's your take on the Comey firing? Cast your vote below. We'll 
post the results Friday. 
The president acted properly and within his powers 
The firing was legal but badly handled 
The firing could be seen as obstructing justice 
The firing was definitely an obstruction of justice

Senators: Trump should relinquish Comey tapes 
Senators including Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Sunday that if President 
Donald Trump recorded conversations with former FBI Director James Comey, 
he should provide those recordings to lawmakers. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-
N.Y., said Democrats might seek to delay a vote on a new FBI director until a 
special prosecutor is appointed to investigate potential connections between 
Trump and Russia.

he should provide those recordings to lawmakers. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-
N.Y., said Democrats might seek to delay a vote on a new FBI director until a 
special prosecutor is appointed to investigate potential connections between 
Trump and Russia.

At least six of President Trump's advisers, including Steve Bannon and Reince 
Priebus, used private email accounts for government business 
Monday, September 25, 2017 8:08 PM EDT 
At least six of President Trump's closest advisers occasionally used private email addresses 
to discuss White House matters, current and former officials said on Monday. 
Officials are supposed to use government emails for their official duties so their 
conversations are available to the public and those conducting oversight. But it is not illegal 
for White House officials to use private email accounts as long as they forward work-related 
messages to their work accounts so they can be preserved. 
During the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Trump repeatedly harped on Hillary Clinton's use of a 
private account as secretary of state, making it a centerpiece of his campaign and using it to 
paint her as untrustworthy. "We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval 
Office," Mr. Trump said last year. His campaign rallies often boiled over with chants of 
"Lock her up!"

R REPRINT OF THIS STORY 
Just days before a Friday deadline, the Justice Department has reassigned the Jeffrey Epstein victims' rights 
case to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta, the attorneys representing Epstein's victims' attorneys said 
Tuesday. 
Miami federal prosecutors, in letter to attorneys for the victims's lawyers on Monday, said they had recused 
themselves from the case, according to Brad Edwards and Jack Scarola, representing Epstein's victims. 
'Mar. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031384 
The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, Byung J. "BJay" Pak, will 
oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta's chief federal 
prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017. 
The Justice Department is still under a Friday deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims' attorneys in 
an effort to settle the case. On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra in Palm Beach ruled that federal 
prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke the law when they concealed a plea 
agreement from more than 30 underage girls in Palm Beach who had been sexually abused by Epstein, a 
multimillionaire New York hedge fund manager. 
Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted Epstein and an untold number of accomplices 
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided Epstein plead guilty to minor charges in 
state court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against Epstein to 
write a 53-page federal indictment, court records show.

An investigation by the Miami Herald, "Perversion of Justice," found that after Acosta met privately with one 
of Epstein's lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not 
even the state court judge who sentenced Epstein — would know the full extent of his crimes. Epstein, now 66, 
was allowed to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where 
he was given liberal work release, and allowed to travel to New York and his private island in the Caribbean 
during his subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between New York, 
Palm Beach and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
The Herald interviewed four of Epstein's victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by 
Epstein. They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead 
of victims. Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which 
grants crime victims the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors. 
Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, but 
they misled the girls into believing that the FBI's sex trafficking case against Epstein was ongoing — when, in 
fact, prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record. 
Marra, noting that he reviewed affidavits, depositions and interrogatories, said "Epstein worked in concert with 
others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031385 
The victims' attorneys — Edwards, Scarola and Paul Cassell — have asked the Justice Department to throw out 
Epstein's plea agreement and reopen the criminal investigation. 
Edwards, who brought the victims' rights case against the government, said transferring the case to another 
jurisdiction is a prudent decision. 
"I think it's good that we're going to get fresh eyes and a fresh opinion on the way the case was handled," 
Edwards said Tuesday. "We were obviously in an adversarial posture with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami 
because they handled the case to begin with." 
Miami's new U.S. Attorney, Ariana Fajardo Orshan — who was appointed by President Trump in September 
— did not respond to a request for comment.

Edwards predicted that it would take some time for Pak's office to review the case, which includes more than 
500 docket entries and thousands of documents. He said If the sides can't agree on a resolution, then Marra 
would likely have to come up with one. The case is being closely watched by crime victims' rights advocates, 
as it will likely set a precedent. 
Acosta, who was appointed by Trump as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017, is the focus of a separate Justice 
Department investigation into whether there was any prosecutorial misconduct in the Epstein case. That probe, 
by the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility, was initiated in response to demands from a bipartisan 
group in Congress, led by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz of Florida. 
In the meantime, a court hearing will be held at 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York in another Epstein-related case. 
A federal appeals court will hear oral arguments in a motion by the Miami Herald, supported by 32 other news 
organizations, asking the court to unseal documents that could reveal details about the extent of Epstein's 
crimes and any other people who may have been involved. 
Three of Epstein's former attorneys — who helped negotiate his plea deal in 2008 — wrote a letter published in 
the New York Times on Monday, defending the plea bargain cut with Acosta as a fair deal. The letter was in 
response to a Times editorial that called on Congress and the Trump administration to hold Acosta and others 
involved in the case accountable. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031386 
Epstein's lawyers said the editorial's conclusions were "in profound conflict with the reality," noting that there 
was no evidence that Epstein committed federal sex trafficking offenses. The letter was signed by former 
Epstein lawyers Kenneth Starr, Jack Goldberger and Lilly Ann Sanchez, as well as Epstein's current attorney, 
Martin G. Weinberg.

Subject: Epstein prosecutor was rebuked for prior child sex case I Miami Herald

Jeffrey Epstein prosecutor was 
previously rebuked for handling of a 
child sex case 
Julie K. Brown 
Nine months before cutting a covert plea deal with sex trafficking suspect Jeffrey 
Epstei , Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was notified that the lead 
prosecutor in Epstein's case had concealed victim information in another underage 
sex crimes case, the Miami Herald has learned. 
The prosecutor, A. Marie Villafaria, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in 
January 2007 for what he called her "intentional and/or serious lapse in judgment" 
when she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who 
traveled to Florida to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, had a prior history of 
predatory behavior with minors, court records show. 
Acosta, her boss at the time, not only knew about Villafaria's breach — records show 
that he subsequently defended it. Acosta assigned another prosecutor in his office to 
write a treatise for the judge in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to soften 
the stinging language in his order. 
Senior U.S. District Court Judge William J. Zloch copied Acosta on his order, 
noting, "The court is at a total loss as to why the Office of the United States Attorney 
for the Southern District of Florida, as well as the Assistant United States Attorney 
assigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold ... 
information from the court."

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021741 
A. Marie Villafaria was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney's office's handling of 
the prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized. 
Later that year, Acosta and Villafaria put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a 
multimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage 
girls at his mansion in Palm Beach. The deal, a federal judge ruled last month, was 
intentionally kept from his victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
While the two cases are unrelated, it shows that both Acosta and Villafaria had been 
warned about the importance of victim disclosure in sex crimes cases before the 
Epstein agreement. They nevertheless forged ahead with a pact with Epstein that 
violated the law. 
U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra wrote: "When the Government gives 
information to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold 
hours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein's 
attorneys, scant information was shared with victims." 
This comes as Acosta, who is now the U.S. secretary of labor, is facing mounting 
scrutiny for his oversight of the Epstein case. On Monday, White House press 
secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether President Trump has full 
confidence in Acosta, noting that Acosta's involvement in the Epstein case is 
GG 
currently under review." 
The Justice Department launched a probe in January into whether Acosta, Villafaria 
and other prosecutors committed professional misconduct. 
Francey Hakes, who worked in the Justice Department's Crimes Against Children 
unit, said Zloch's comments were so brutal that it should have deterred Acosta and 
Villafaria from keeping the deal secret. 
"It is highly unusual for a court to allege an assistant U.S. attorney has intentionally 
withheld information. That allegation is like dropping a bomb in the legal 
community," she said. 
The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender's remarkable deal 
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. 
"It seems to show that they are not taking these cases very seriously, they are not 
advocating for strong punishment for sexual predators, and not advocating for 
victims in a meaningful way." 
Villafaria, a well-regarded 18-year veteran federal prosecutor, would not comment 
for this story. But her lawyer, Jonathan Biran, said she has worked tirelessly on 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021742 
behalf of crime victims. She received the 2011 National Crime Victims' Rights 
Service Award as well as the Attorney General's Project Safe Childhood Award. 
He also pointed out that the parents of the victim in the Texas man's case wrote a 
letter thanking Villafaria at the conclusion of the case. 
"AUSA Villafaria has spent her 18-year career advocating tirelessly on behalf of 
victims of some of the most serious crimes in Florida, and has received numerous 
awards for her successful prosecution of major cases," Biran said, adding that 
Villafaria has "made South Florida a safer place for children and adults alike." 
Enticing a minor 
By all accounts, Adam McDaniel was an awkward and shy Texas teenager who spent 
countless hours on his computer, socializing with girls on the internet. 
In 2005, McDaniel, then 19, traveled from Texas to Fort Lauderdale, where he 
hopped into a taxi and headed to Boca Raton to meet up with a 14-year-old girl he 
had been talking to online for about a year. He picked up the ninth grader at a high 
school basketball game, and drove her to a Marriott, hotel where they spent the 
night, court records show. 
When she failed to come home that evening, her parents called Boca Raton police. 
Officers tracked the pair down at the hotel the next day, where they found them in 
bed, clad in little more than their underwear, according to court records. 
McDaniel was arrested on federal sex charges, and pleaded guilty on Oct. 6, 2006, to 
enticing a minor into sexual conduct by means of interstate commerce, which 
carried a sentence of from five years up to 30 years in federal prison. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021743 
U.S. District Judge William Zloch 
At sentencing, McDaniel's public defender, Patrick Hunt, argued for a reduced 
sentence, blaming his client's immaturity for the crime. McDaniel had been a good 
student at Texas Tech and had a family that supported him, Hunt told Zloch. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021744 
Family and acquaintances, including a former Fort Worth police lieutenant, 
submitted letters to the court vouching for McDaniel's character. 
There were other issues, however, presented to the judge. While McDaniel was 
being held in federal lockup awaiting sentencing, he had corresponded with his 
victim, despite being ordered not to contact her, the court record shows. 
Still, Hunt argued that a sentence of five years was overly harsh. 
Villafaria disagreed, but conceded that McDaniel would benefit from psychological 
treatment. She advocated for a sentence of five to sex years, which was at the low 
end of the guideline. 
It was then that the judge heard from the victim's mother. 
In a statement, the mother decried the emotional and mental trauma her daughter 
suffered and the long road to recovery she had ahead of her. The mother mentioned 
she was further upset that McDaniel continued contact with her daughter after his 
arrest and she said she believed that McDaniel was still trying to manipulate her 
daughter by blaming her for his arrest. 
The mother pointed out that prior to their sexual encounter, McDaniel had directed 
her daughter to watch sexually explicit movies and had described for her sex 
activities he had had with another underage girl. 
At that point, the judge interrupted. 
"...There has been some reference to another incident with a minor girl. What do 
you know about that, if anything?" Zloch asked Villafaria. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021745 
Former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta never told sexual-abuse victims of a lenient plea 
deal for Jeffrey Epstein.

Only then did Zloch learn that McDaniel had preyed on other girls over the internet, 
including a 16-year-old California girl whom he brought to Texas and impregnated. 
He was also having another relationship with a 15-year-old girl at the time of his 
arrest, Villafaria admitted in court. 
The judge promptly sentenced McDaniel to 10 years — twice what Villafaria 
recommended. 
Three months later, in January 2007, after reviewing the entire case, Zloch issued 
an order excoriating Villafaria for failing to tell him about McDaniel's prior history. 
"The serial nature of defendant's seduction of minor girls was revealed for the first 
time to the court upon the Government's response to the Court's inquiry," Zloch 
wrote, explaining that the defendant's past was evidence of predatory behavior that 
warranted a harsher sentence because he may pose a danger to the community. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lourie was assigned to try to correct the record and 
persuade the judge to strike a portion of his comments. They argued that since 
McDaniel had never before been charged with a crime, the history was not relevant 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021746 
at sentencing. The defendant's prior relationship with a 16-year-old was not illegal 
in Texas or in California, they said, and the girl classified her relationship as a 
friendship. 
All the relevant information was provided to the probation department and at 
McDaniel's detention hearing, they added, making the point that it was in the record 
and therefore, not intentionally withheld by the government. 
While Zloch conceded that the information was part of the probation and bond 
hearing record, he said it was nevertheless the U.S. Attorney's Office's duty to 
present the defendant's prior history with minors at sentencing. He refused to strike 
the most critical portions of his order. 
"Lack of candor to the court is a serious charge, and the judge has quite reasonably 
expressed dismay that the assistant U.S. attorney apparently intended that he never 
be given a full picture of the defendant's conduct," Hakes said. 
But nine months later, in September 2007, Villafaria was in the throes of thorny 
negotiations with Epstein's lawyers. While an FBI investigation was ongoing, 
Villafaria discussed ways to quietly resolve the case, emails show. 
A Miami Herald investigation, -Perversion of Justice," published in November, 
revealed how federal prosecutors, including Acosta and Villafaria, tried to keep the 
full scope of Epstein's crimes out of the public eye. At one point, they discussed 
charging Epstein in Miami, instead of Palm Beach where the crimes happened, 
noting there would be less media coverage. 
Emails also show that prosecutors repeatedly abided by Epstein's lawyers' demands 
that his victims not be told that an agreement had been reached until after he was 
sentenced. That meant that the girls could not appear at the hearing to derail the 
deal. Prosecutors had drafted a 53-page federal indictment on sex trafficking 
charges, but Acosta instead allowed Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution 
charges in state court. In exchange, Epstein and his co-conspirators were given 
federal immunity. 
Villafaria wrote Epstein's lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, to discuss the wording of the 
sentencing agreement for the judge: 
"I will include all our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and 
I will mention co-conspirators, but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of 
the other crimes and all the other persons we could charge," Villafaria wrote. 
At Epstein's sentencing, assistant Palm Beach prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek was 
questioned by the judge about whether all of Epstein's victims were told about the 
deal, as required by law. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021747 
"Are there more than one victim?" Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo asked 
Belohlavek at the June 30, 2008 sentencing. 
"There's several," Belohlavek replied. 
"Are all the victims in both these cases in agreement with the terms of the plea?" the 
judge asked. 
"Yes," Belohlavek said. 
Coincidentally, the lawyer representing one of the victims was in the courtroom that 
day. He told the Herald that neither he, nor his client, was told about the agreement. 
Acosta has not responded to the Herald's repeated requests for comment. A 
spokesman at the Labor Department told the Washington Post last month: "The 
office's decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed 
departmental procedures." 
In the past, Acosta has said that he believed the deal was the best chance 
prosecutors had of ensuring that Epstein spent some time behind bars and was 
required to register as a sex offender. Epstein served 13 months in the Palm Beach 
County jail — but he was allowed to leave for up to 12 hours a day as part of a work 
release program not normally offered to convicted sex offenders. 
Epstein's victims, now in their late 20S and 30s, are fighting to have his deal 
overturned and Epstein sent to prison. 
Bradley Edwards, who represents several of Epstein's victims, defended Villafaria, 
saying he believed that she was directed to settle the case and not inform Epstein's 
victims about the deal. 
"In my conversations with her, I came to believe that she was in a difficult position. 
She never came out and said this, but I suspected that someone above her directed 
her to do what she did," Edwards said.

Jeffrey Epstein prosecutor was 
previously rebuked for handling of a 
child sex case 
Julie K. Brown 
Nine months before cutting a covert plea deal with sex trafficking suspect Jeffrey 
Epstei , Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was notified that the lead 
prosecutor in Epstein's case had concealed victim information in another underage 
sex crimes case, the Miami Herald has learned. 
The prosecutor, A. Marie Villafaria, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in 
January 2007 for what he called her "intentional and/or serious lapse in judgment" 
when she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who 
traveled to Florida to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, had a prior history of 
predatory behavior with minors, court records show. 
Acosta, her boss at the time, not only knew about Villafaria's breach — records show 
that he subsequently defended it. Acosta assigned another prosecutor in his office to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021750 
write a treatise for the judge in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to soften 
the stinging language in his order. 
Senior U.S. District Court Judge William J. Zloch copied Acosta on his order, 
noting, "The court is at a total loss as to why the Office of the United States Attorney 
for the Southern District of Florida, as well as the Assistant United States Attorney 
assigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold ... 
information from the court." 
<Sp_Marie_Villafana2.jpg> 
A. Marie Villafaria was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney's office's handling of 
the prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized. 
Later that year, Acosta and Villafaria put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a 
multimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage 
girls at his mansion in Palm Beach. The deal, a federal judge ruled last month, was 
intentionally kept from his victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
While the two cases are unrelated, it shows that both Acosta and Villafaria had been 
warned about the importance of victim disclosure in sex crimes cases before the 
Epstein agreement. They nevertheless forged ahead with a pact with Epstein that 
violated the law. 
U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra wrote: "When the Government gives 
information to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold 
hours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein's 
attorneys, scant information was shared with victims." 
This comes as Acosta, who is now the U.S. secretary of labor, is facing mounting 
scrutiny for his oversight of the Epstein case. On Monday, White House press 
secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether President Trump has full 
confidence in Acosta, noting that Acosta's involvement in the Epstein case is 
GG 
currently under review." 
The Justice Department launched a probe in January into whether Acosta, Villafaria 
and other prosecutors committed professional misconduct. 
Francey Hakes, who worked in the Justice Department's Crimes Against Children 
unit, said Zloch's comments were so brutal that it should have deterred Acosta and 
Villafaria from keeping the deal secret. 
"It is highly unusual for a court to allege an assistant U.S. attorney has intentionally 
withheld information. That allegation is like dropping a bomb in the legal 
community," she said. 
The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender's remarkable deal 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021751 
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. 
"It seems to show that they are not taking these cases very seriously, they are not 
advocating for strong punishment for sexual predators, and not advocating for 
victims in a meaningful way." 
Villafaria, a well-regarded 18-year veteran federal prosecutor, would not comment 
for this story. But her lawyer, Jonathan Biran, said she has worked tirelessly on 
behalf of crime victims. She received the 2011 National Crime Victims' Rights 
Service Award as well as the Attorney General's Project Safe Childhood Award. 
He also pointed out that the parents of the victim in the Texas man's case wrote a 
letter thanking Villafaria at the conclusion of the case. 
"AUSA Villafaria has spent her 18-year career advocating tirelessly on behalf of 
victims of some of the most serious crimes in Florida, and has received numerous 
awards for her successful prosecution of major cases," Biran said, adding that 
Villafaria has "made South Florida a safer place for children and adults alike." 
Enticing a minor 
By all accounts, Adam McDaniel was an awkward and shy Texas teenager who spent 
countless hours on his computer, socializing with girls on the internet. 
In 2005, McDaniel, then 19, traveled from Texas to Fort Lauderdale, where he 
hopped into a taxi and headed to Boca Raton to meet up with a 14-year-old girl he 
had been talking to online for about a year. He picked up the ninth grader at a high 
school basketball game, and drove her to a Marriott, hotel where they spent the 
night, court records show. 
When she failed to come home that evening, her parents called Boca Raton police. 
Officers tracked the pair down at the hotel the next day, where they found them in 
bed, clad in little more than their underwear, according to court records. 
McDaniel was arrested on federal sex charges, and pleaded guilty on Oct. 6, 2006, to 
enticing a minor into sexual conduct by means of interstate commerce, which 
carried a sentence of from five years up to 30 years in federal prison. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021752 
U.S. District Judge William Zloch 
At sentencing, McDaniel's public defender, Patrick Hunt, argued for a reduced 
sentence, blaming his client's immaturity for the crime. McDaniel had been a good 
student at Texas Tech and had a family that supported him, Hunt told Zloch. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021753 
Family and acquaintances, including a former Fort Worth police lieutenant, 
submitted letters to the court vouching for McDaniel's character. 
There were other issues, however, presented to the judge. While McDaniel was 
being held in federal lockup awaiting sentencing, he had corresponded with his 
victim, despite being ordered not to contact her, the court record shows. 
Still, Hunt argued that a sentence of five years was overly harsh. 
Villafaria disagreed, but conceded that McDaniel would benefit from psychological 
treatment. She advocated for a sentence of five to sex years, which was at the low 
end of the guideline. 
It was then that the judge heard from the victim's mother. 
In a statement, the mother decried the emotional and mental trauma her daughter 
suffered and the long road to recovery she had ahead of her. The mother mentioned 
she was further upset that McDaniel continued contact with her daughter after his 
arrest and she said she believed that McDaniel was still trying to manipulate her 
daughter by blaming her for his arrest. 
The mother pointed out that prior to their sexual encounter, McDaniel had directed 
her daughter to watch sexually explicit movies and had described for her sex 
activities he had had with another underage girl. 
At that point, the judge interrupted. 
"...There has been some reference to another incident with a minor girl. What do 
you know about that, if anything?" Zloch asked Villafaria. 
<acosta.jpg> 
Former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta never told sexual-abuse victims of a lenient plea 
deal for Jeffrey Epstein. 
Getty Images 
Only then did Zloch learn that McDaniel had preyed on other girls over the internet, 
including a 16-year-old California girl whom he brought to Texas and impregnated. 
He was also having another relationship with a 15-year-old girl at the time of his 
arrest, Villafaria admitted in court. 
The judge promptly sentenced McDaniel to 10 years — twice what Villafaria 
recommended. 
Three months later, in January 2007, after reviewing the entire case, Zloch issued 
an order excoriating Villafaria for failing to tell him about McDaniel's prior history. 
"The serial nature of defendant's seduction of minor girls was revealed for the first 
time to the court upon the Government's response to the Court's inquiry," Zloch 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021754 
wrote, explaining that the defendant's past was evidence of predatory behavior that 
warranted a harsher sentence because he may pose a danger to the community. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lourie was assigned to try to correct the record and 
persuade the judge to strike a portion of his comments. They argued that since 
McDaniel had never before been charged with a crime, the history was not relevant 
at sentencing. The defendant's prior relationship with a 16-year-old was not illegal 
in Texas or in California, they said, and the girl classified her relationship as a 
friendship. 
All the relevant information was provided to the probation department and at 
McDaniel's detention hearing, they added, making the point that it was in the record 
and therefore, not intentionally withheld by the government. 
While Zloch conceded that the information was part of the probation and bond 
hearing record, he said it was nevertheless the U.S. Attorney's Office's duty to 
present the defendant's prior history with minors at sentencing. He refused to strike 
the most critical portions of his order. 
"Lack of candor to the court is a serious charge, and the judge has quite reasonably 
expressed dismay that the assistant U.S. attorney apparently intended that he never 
be given a full picture of the defendant's conduct," Hakes said. 
But nine months later, in September 2007, Villafaria was in the throes of thorny 
negotiations with Epstein's lawyers. While an FBI investigation was ongoing, 
Villafaria discussed ways to quietly resolve the case, emails show. 
A Miami Herald investigation, "Perversion of Justice,"  published in November, 
revealed how federal prosecutors, including Acosta and Villafaria, tried to keep the 
full scope of Epstein's crimes out of the public eye. At one point, they discussed 
charging Epstein in Miami, instead of Palm Beach where the crimes happened, 
noting there would be less media coverage. 
Emails also show that prosecutors repeatedly abided by Epstein's lawyers' demands 
that his victims not be told that an agreement had been reached until after he was 
sentenced. That meant that the girls could not appear at the hearing to derail the 
deal. Prosecutors had drafted a 53-page federal indictment on sex trafficking 
charges, but Acosta instead allowed Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution 
charges in state court. In exchange, Epstein and his co-conspirators were given 
federal immunity. 
Villafaria wrote Epstein's lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, to discuss the wording of the 
sentencing agreement for the judge: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021755 
"I will include all our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and 
I will mention co-conspirators, but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of 
the other crimes and all the other persons we could charge," Villafaria wrote. 
At Epstein's sentencing, assistant Palm Beach prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek was 
questioned by the judge about whether all of Epstein's victims were told about the 
deal, as required by law. 
"Are there more than one victim?" Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo asked 
Belohlavek at the June 30, 2008 sentencing. 
"There's several," Belohlavek replied. 
"Are all the victims in both these cases in agreement with the terms of the plea?" the 
judge asked. 
"Yes," Belohlavek said. 
Coincidentally, the lawyer representing one of the victims was in the courtroom that 
day. He told the Herald that neither he, nor his client, was told about the agreement. 
Acosta has not responded to the Herald's repeated requests for comment. A 
spokesman at the Labor Department told the Washington Post last month: "The 
office's decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed 
departmental procedures." 
In the past, Acosta has said that he believed the deal was the best chance 
prosecutors had of ensuring that Epstein spent some time behind bars and was 
required to register as a sex offender. Epstein served 13 months in the Palm Beach 
County jail — but he was allowed to leave for up to 12 hours a day as part of a work 
release program not normally offered to convicted sex offenders. 
Epstein's victims, now in their late 20S and 30s, are fighting to have his deal 
overturned and Epstein sent to prison. 
Bradley Edwards, who represents several of Epstein's victims, defended Villafaria, 
saying he believed that she was directed to settle the case and not inform Epstein's 
victims about the deal. 
"In my conversations with her, I came to believe that she was in a difficult position. 
She never came out and said this, but I suspected that someone above her directed 
her to do what she did," Edwards said.

Top aide of Jeffrey Epstein 
prosecutor Acosta: We acted with 
integrity 
February 15, 2019 12:17 PM 
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. By Emily Michot I Julie K. Brown  
A former top prosecutor involved in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case is defending his old 
boss, Alexander Acosta, whose decision to craft a secret plea deal with the wealthy 
New York hedge fund manager has come under federal scrutiny. 
In his first public comments on the 10-year-old case, Jeffrey H. Sloman — who at 
the time was second in command under Acosta at the U.S. Attorney's Office in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023126 
Miami — said prosecutors resolved the case based on the facts and evidence, and 
what he called "legal impediments," including the belief that many of Epstein's 
teenage victims were too "terrified" to cooperate in the case. 
"Given the obstacles we faced in fashioning a robust federal prosecution, we decided 
to negotiate a resolution," said Sloman, now in private practice. "We did not reach 
this decision lightly and it came only after significant and often rancorous internal 
debate." 
Jeffrey Sloman, who was second-in-command to then-U.S. Attorney Alexander 
Acosta when the latter was deciding whether to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein, says the 
office handled the case properly. Aixa Montero Holt 
In a lengthy opinion piece  submitted to the Miami Herald Editorial Board, Sloman 
alleges that the attacks on Acosta's role in the controversial case are politically 
driven by critics who failed to raise significant issues when Acosta was nominated 
and confirmed as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017. 
Sloman's comments come two weeks after the Justice Department announced it had 
opened an investigation over whether there was prosecutorial misconduct in the 
case involving Epstein, who ran a sex pyramid scheme from his Palm Beach estate 
that targeted scores of underage girls from 2001 to 2006. 
About 30 members of Congress demanded the probe following a Miami Herald 
series of stories, "Perversion of Justice," that detailed how federal prosecutors, led 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023127 
by Acosta, stitched together an unusual immunity deal that allowed Epstein to 
escape what could have been a life sentence in federal prison. 
U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta has been criticized for the plea deal he 
worked out with Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta was U.S. attorney for Southern Florida at 
the time. Alan Diaz 
Instead, Epstein — whose friends included President Donald Trump, former 
President Bill Clinton and other politically connected people — was allowed to 
quietly plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court. He served 13 months in 
the county jail, where he was allowed liberal work release privileges rarely given to 
sex offenders in Florida and barred by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Department's own 
rules. 
He was released in 2009, but his victims — who were 13 to 16 years old at the time — 
are still fighting more than a decade later to have his non-prosecution agreement 
overturned. 
In his op-ed, Sloman called Acosta "an outstanding public servant ... at risk of 
becoming collateral damage in Washington's latest polarized conflagration," adding, 
"I won't let it happen without first being heard." 
Jeffrey Epstein apologizes, but not to his victims 
Jeffrey Epstein, a multimillionaire who molested dozens of underage girls, and is 
suspected of trafficking countless other girls around the world, issued a public 
apology Tuesday. It was not to the victims of his abuse, but to one of their lawyers. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023128 
"As additional details about Epstein's crimes have emerged, it is clear to me that we 
should have pushed for much harsher terms," Sloman wrote. "That said, some have 
mistakenly suggested that our office kowtowed to Epstein's high-priced defense 
lawyers or, worse, that his lawyers corrupted or intimidated us into submission. ... 
Nothing could be further from the truth." 
Sloman did not directly address the chief complaint brought by Epstein's victims, 
who are now in their late 20S and early 30s. Those who spoke to the Herald said 
they felt betrayed by federal prosecutors, who sealed the non-prosecution agreement 
from public view so that they wouldn't find out about it before he was sentenced. It 
would be almost a year before they were successful in having it unsealed. By then, it 
was too late to try to derail it. 
They allege, in a federal lawsuit filed against the government, that prosecutors 
deliberately kept the deal secret — in violation of federal law — to prevent them 
from appearing at Epstein's sentencing to possibly undo the deal. Nor did Sloman 
address why prosecutors also gave immunity to a number of Epstein's co-
conspirators, who have never been identified. 
"They cut a deal which they have to know was a failure," said Marci Hamilton, a law 
professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of Child USA, 
which advocates for children's civil liberties. " They kept it secret and they didn't 
charge the co-conspirators. The horror of this is if you don't hold all the 'Johns' 
accountable, then it doesn't stop. This case involved multiple girls, multiple men, 
multiple recruiters, multiple times and he recruited girls to get other girls. That's a 
trafficking organization." 
Acosta has not commented since 2011, when he defended his decisions in a publicly 
issued letter that can be found in the federal court file. In it, he described what he 
called a "yearlong assault" on prosecutors by Epstein's "army of legal superstars," 
including Roy Black, Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz, among others. In four 
long paragraphs, Acosta detailed how defense attorneys relentlessly worked to 
manipulate the negotiation process, often frustrating prosecutors. 
"They would obtain concessions as part of a negotiation and agree to proceed, only 
to change their minds, and appeal the office's decision to Washington," Acosta 
wrote, adding that their tactics included delving into the private family lives of 
individual prosecutors in an effort to discredit them and get them removed from the 
case. 
Wrote Sloman: "The Herald's 'Perversion of Justice' series presented a heartrending 
portrait of Epstein's victims and made a strong case that he should have gone to jail 
much longer, but never explained or substantiated its accusation that we schemed 
with Epstein's lawyers." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023129 
The Herald's series quoted a trove of letters and emails between prosecutors and 
Epstein's defense team that showed that Epstein's lawyers were allowed to dictate 
the terms of each deal that they drew up, and prosecutors repeatedly backed down 
on deadlines. The lead prosecutor, Marie Villafaria, amid the negotiations wrote to 
Epstein lawyer Jay Lefkowitz: "I thought we had worked very well together in 
resolving this dispute. ... I feel that I bent over backwards to keep in mind the effect 
that the agreement would have on Mr. Epstein." 
Where are they now? The biggest players in the Jeffrey Epstein case 
The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their 
cause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's 
employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have 
prospered. 
The email chain also shows that prosecutors sometimes communicated with the 
defense team using private emails, and that their correspondence referenced 
discussions that they wanted to have by phone or in person so that there would be 
no paper trail, the Herald found. At one point, Acosta met privately with Lefkowitz, 
who came from the same Washington, D.C.-based law firm, at a Marriott hotel in 
West Palm Beach, the emails showed. It was at that meeting, the records show, 
when Acosta agreed to keep the deal secret. 
The correspondences also show that Sloman sought several times to have Epstein's 
victims notified about the deal, as required under the Crime Victims Rights Act. But 
after Epstein's lawyers aggressively objected and appealed to Acosta, it never 
happened. 
Sloman, however, insisted that Epstein's lawyers' aggressive defense had no bearing 
on the office's decision to set aside what court records show was a 53-page federal 
indictment it had prepared against Epstein. Sloman said the facts dictated that 
Epstein should plead guilty to what he called "a crime in state court that reflected 
his true conduct," adding that the case was "at heart, a local sex case." 
"It is a gross mischaracterization to describe this as a local sex case," said lawyer 
Jack Scarola, a representative of several of Epstein's then-underage victims. "There 
was ample evidence that Epstein was operating on a large international scale. The 
involvement of the federal government was a consequence of evidence that children 
were crossing national and state borders for the purpose of prostitution." 
At the time that the case was closed, FBI investigators had identified nearly 40 
victims — and more were coming forward — who said they had been molested or 
sexually assaulted by Epstein and some of his co-conspirators. One of those victims, 
Courtney Wild, told the Herald that she brought at least 6o girls to his waterfront 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023130 
Palm Beach estate over time. She wanted Epstein prosecuted — and was willing to 
testify — but prosecutors never gave her the chance, she told the Herald. 
In addition, FBI records show that agents had traveled to New York and New 
Mexico to interview other possible victims, the Herald found. The non-prosecution 
deal that was struck was filed under seal. The result was that no one — not even the 
judge — would know the full scope of Epstein's crimes and how many victims were 
involved. 
Acosta, who now heads a federal agency with oversight of international child labor 
laws and human trafficking, was personally involved in the negotiations, records, 
letters and emails show. 
AG nominee Barr pledges to look into handling of Epstein case 
Sen. Ben Sasse questioned attorney general nominee William Barr about the Jeffrey 
Epstein case on January 15, 2019, getting the nominee to commit to having the 
Department of Justice look into the handling of that case if confirmed. 
By C-SPAN 
Sloman reiterated Acosta's earlier contention that most of Epstein's victims 
wouldn't cooperate. 
"So somehow, had Epstein been a child molester of one or two victims, then they 
would have prosecuted him?" said Wild's attorney, Brad Edwards, in an interview 
with the Herald for its series published in November. "But because he molested 
hundreds of victims and some of them wouldn't testify, then they are saying, 'we 
can't prosecute.' How absurd is that argument?" 
Edwards tried unsuccessfully to block the plea deal in federal court. In 2008, days 
after Epstein was sentenced, he filed an emergency order, alleging that the 
agreement was illegal because it violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which 
grants crime victims certain rights, including the right to confer with prosecutors 
and be notified of a plea deal. The lawsuit is still pending a decade later. 
"There is a reason for the Crime Victims Rights Act — so that prosecutors don't 
preempt a victim's ability to speak for themselves about a proposed plea bargain," 
Scarola said. "Here, the decision was being made secretly for them."

For years, Jeffrey Epstein abused teen girls, police say. A 
timeline of his case 
PERVERSION 
ofJUSTIC 
A decade before #MeToo, a multimillionaire sex offender from Florida got the 
ultimate break. 
2005 
March: A 14-year-old girl and her parents report that Jeffrey Epstein molested her 
at a mansion in Palm Beach. She said a female acquaintance and classmate at Royal 
Palm Beach High School had taken her to the house to give him a massage in 
exchange for money. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023002 
Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly engaged in sexual activity with underage girls at his 
waterfront Palm Beach home on El Brillo Way, according to police in the Town of 
Palm Beach. Epstein also owns residences in New York City and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, among other locales. Emily Michot emichotPmiamiherald.com  
April: Palm Beach police begin trash pulls at Epstein's home, discovering a 
telephone message for Epstein with the girl's name on it, and a time that matched 
the time that she told police she was there. They find the names and phone numbers 
of other girls on message slips in his trash. 
October: With the police probe in full swing, one of Epstein's assistants calls one of 
the girls just as she is being questioned by police. Investigators begin interviewing 
more girls, as well as Epstein's butlers, who tell them that Epstein had frequent 
visits from girls throughout the day. On Oct. 20, they execute a search warrant at his 
house on El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. 
2006 
May: Police sign a probable cause affidavit charging Epstein and two of his 
assistants with multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor. The Palm Beach 
state attorney, Barry Krischer, instead refers the case to a grand jury.

Palm Beach police were unhappy with the handling of the Epstein case by then-State 
Attorney Barry Krischer. 
June: The grand jury, after hearing from only one girl, returns an indictment of one 
count of solicitation of prostitution. The charge does not reflect that the victim in 
question and others were minors. 
July: Epstein's powerhouse legal team tries to negotiate a deal with the State 
Attorney's Office. Lawyers discuss a deferred prosecution in which Epstein would 
enter a pretrial intervention program and serve no jail time. 
July: After pressure from the Palm Beach police chief, the FBI opens a federal 
investigation, dubbed "Operation Leap Year." Documents list the possible crime as 
"child prostitution." 
November: The FBI begins interviewing potential witnesses and victims from 
Florida, New York and New Mexico. 
2007 
May: As the U.S. Attorney's Office prepares to present the case to a federal grand 
jury, Epstein's attorneys request a meeting to discuss the investigation. 
June: A 53-page indictment is prepared by the U.S. Attorney's Office as, 
simultaneously, plea negotiations are initiated with Epstein's legal team. 
July: Grand jury subpoenas are issued for Epstein's computers, which were 
apparently removed from his Palm Beach home prior to the police search. 
August: The U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, enters into direct 
discussions about the plea agreement; a motion to compel production of Epstein's 
computers is delayed. 
September: Federal prosecutors draw up several federal plea agreements that are 
rejected by Epstein and his attorneys. Epstein signs a non-prosecution agreement 
on Sept. 24, but his attorneys continue to delay his court appearance.

Alexander Acosta has been criticized for his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case as 
U.S. attorney. He later became the dean of Florida International University's law 
school and, later still, President Trump's secretary of labor. Miami Herald file photo 
October: With the non-prosecution agreement still being debated, Acosta meets 
with Epstein lawyer Jay Lefkowitz at the West Palm Beach Marriott on Okeechobee 
Road to discuss finalizing a deal. Among the terms agreed upon: that the victims 
would not be notified, that the deal would be kept under seal and all grand jury 
subpoenas would be canceled.

The Marriott hotel in West Palm Beach, at 1001 Okeechobee Blvd., is where U.S. 
Attorney Alexander Acosta met with Jeffrey Epstein's attorney to work out a plea 
arrangement. Emily Michot emichotPmiamiherald.com  
November: Epstein's lawyers object to an addendum to the agreement. The 
provision called for a special master to appoint an attorney to represent Epstein 
victims' rights to civil compensation. 
December: The two sides continue to debate the addendum. Epstein attorney 
Kenneth Starr asks for a review of the agreement by the U.S. Department of Justice 
in Washington, further delaying its execution. Victims are told the investigation is 
continuing. 
2008 
January: Epstein attorney, Lefkowitz, calls Acosta, telling him his client will not go 
through with the agreement because it requires him to register as a sex offender. 
February: With the plea negotiations and the Justice Department review still in 
limbo, the FBI continues its probe, locating more witnesses and evidence. 
March: Preparations are made for a new federal grand jury presentation. In court 
documents, the U.S. Attorney's Office notes that Epstein's victims are being 
harassed by his lawyers, who are not specifically named. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023007 
May: The Justice Department issues finding that, if a plea deal is not reached, 
Epstein can be federally prosecuted. 
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. 
June: Epstein's lawyers revisit plea negotiations, and on June 30, Epstein appears 
in a Palm Beach County courtroom. He pleads guilty to state charges: one count of 
solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor 
under the age of 18. He is sentenced to 18 months in jail, followed by a year of 
community control or house arrest. He is adjudicated as a convicted sex offender 
who must register twice a year in Florida. 
July: Epstein's victims learn about his plea in state court after the fact. They file an 
emergency petition to force federal prosecutors to comply with the federal Crime 
Victims' Rights Act, which mandates certain rights for crime victims, including the 
right to be informed about plea agreements and the right to appear at sentencing. 
August: Epstein's victims learn that he has already been sent to jail, and that the 
federal investigation is over. They seek to have his plea agreement unsealed, but 
federal prosecutors argue against releasing the agreement, commencing a yearlong 
court battle to learn the terms of Epstein's plea bargain. 
October: Epstein begins work release from the county stockade. He is picked up by 
his private driver six days a week and transported to an office in West Palm Beach, 
where he accepts visitors for up to 12 hours a day. He returns to the stockade in the 
evenings to sleep.

The Miami Herald obtained thousands of FBI and court records, lawsuits, and 
witness depositions, and went to federal court in New York to access sealed 
documents in the reporting of "Perversion of Justice." The Herald also tracked down 
more than 6o women who said they were victims, some of whom had never spoken 
of the abuse before.

2009 
July: Epstein is released from the Palm Beach County stockade, five months early. 
He must register as a sex offender and is on probation for a year, confined to his 
Palm Beach home except to travel to his office in West Palm Beach. However, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023008 
records show he frequently makes trips to Manhattan and to his home in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. 
August: Palm Beach Police Capt. George Frick finds Epstein walking along AiA in 
the middle of the afternoon, when he was supposed to be at work in his office in 
downtown West Palm Beach. Epstein says he is walking to work, even though the 
location where he is found is not a direct route to his office. His probation officer 
says Epstein has permission to get some exercise. 
September: The federal non-prosecution agreement is made public. By 
September, at least a dozen civil lawsuits have been filed by women who allege they 
were molested by Epstein when they were underage. Epstein begins the process of 
settling them out of court.

Rodriguez, did, for obstruction of justice. He was busted for hiding Epstein's journal 
and trying to sell it. He has since died. © Facebook 
November: One of Epstein's former butlers tries to sell to an undercover FBI agent 
a black book filled with the names of hundreds of girls and young women that 
Epstein allegedly procured for sex and massages. The butler tells FBI agents he 
witnessed nude underage girls at Epstein's pool and had known that the millionaire 
was having sex with them. He also said he saw pornography involving underage girls 
on Epstein's computers. The butler/houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, is later charged 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023010 
with obstruction of justice and sentenced to federal prison. He dies in 2015. The 
contents of the black book become public as part of several civil lawsuits. 
2010 
April: Flight logs obtained as part of civil lawsuits against Epstein show an 
assortment of politicians, academics, celebrities, heads of state and world leaders 
flying on Epstein's jets in the early 2000s. Among them: former President Bill 
Clinton, former national security adviser Sandy Berger, former Colombian President 
Andres Pastrana and lawyer Alan Dershowitz. 
2011 
March: Two of Epstein's victims file a motion in federal court accusing the 
government of violating their rights by failing to notify them about the plea deal and 
keeping it secret. Among other things, they want the plea deal invalidated in the 
hopes of sending Epstein to prison. They accuse federal prosecutors of deceiving 
them with "false notification letters." 
September: U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra rejects the U.S. Attorney's Office 
argument that it was under no obligation to notify victims prior to striking a non-
prosecution agreement with Epstein because there were no federal charges filed 
against him. The decision marks a victory for Epstein's victims, but the case will 
drag on for seven more years. 
November: Epstein must register in New York as the highest and most dangerous 
level of sex offender, despite efforts by him and the New York District Attorney's 
office to lower the classification. A Level 3 status means "high risk of repeat offense 
and a threat to public safety exists," according to the state's guidelines. 
2012 
March-December: Calling himself a "celebrated philanthropist" and a "renowned 
educational investor," Epstein undertakes a public relations campaign to counter 
bad press about his sexual exploits. His foundation donates millions to scientific 
research and sponsors global conferences on ways to achieve world peace and save 
the planet. He funds cancer and educational research projects around the country. 
2015 
Virginia Roberts was working at Mar-a-Lago when she was recruited to be a 
masseuse to Palm Beach hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein. She was lured into a 
life of depravity and sexual abuse. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023011 
January: Virginia Roberts files court papers in Florida claiming that she was 
forced by Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew and lawyer Alan Dershowitz when 
she was underage. In a sworn affidavit, she provides photographs of her with the 
prince and with Epstein's close associate, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. She 
claims Maxwell worked as Epstein's madam, which she denies. Dershowitz and the 
prince deny her claims as well, setting off a series of legal actions between 
Dershowitz and Roberts' attorneys that are later resolved in an out-of-court 
settlement. 
April: A federal judge rules that Roberts cannot join the federal Crime Victims' 
Rights Act lawsuit and that her affidavit — accusing Prince Andrew and Dershowitz 
of having sex with her when she was underage — be stricken from the case. 
Dershowitz said the ruling meant he was vindicated. However, the judge does not 
address the veracity of Roberts' claims, writing: "The factual details regarding with 
whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and 
impertinent to this central claim." 
September: Roberts sues Maxwell in federal court in New York, claiming that 
Epstein's alleged madam defamed her in public statements in the media. The 
lawsuit is widely viewed as a vessel for Epstein's victims to expose the scope of 
Epstein's crimes. Several civil lawsuits filed the same year allege that Epstein and 
Maxwell operated an international sex trafficking operation.

Epstein. Her life had already been marred by sexual abuse even before she met the 
multimillionaire. Emily Michot emichotPmiamiherald.com  
2016 
June: A lawsuit is filed in Manhattan by a woman who once used the name Katie 
Johnson, claiming that she was raped by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump 
at a party at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 1994 when she was 13 years old. 
Trump and Epstein both categorically deny it ever happened.

'How in the world, do you, the U.S. attorney, engage in a negotiation with a criminal 
defendant, basically allowing that criminal defendant to write up the agreement?' 
said Bradley Edwards, shown here, who is representing some of the victims of serial 
sex abuser and Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Emily Michot 
emichotPmiamiherald.com  
November: Johnson backs out of a press conference just days before Election Day, 
saying she had been threatened and was fearful. She later drops the lawsuit. 
2017 
February: President Trump nominates former Miami federal prosecutor Acosta as 
U.S. secretary of labor. Acosta is compelled at his confirmation hearing to briefly 
address questions about the deal he approved for Epstein. One lawmaker requests 
more records from the Epstein case. Acosta is confirmed. 
June: Roberts settles her lawsuit with Maxwell for an undisclosed sum. 
2018 
December: Civil trial is scheduled in Palm Beach County Court on Bradley 
Edwards' allegations that Epstein sued him to punish him for representing several 
of his victims. The malicious-prosecution lawsuit is set to begin Dec. 4. Epstein has 
indicated he will not appear in court for trial. 
The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their 
cause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's

employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have 
prospered.
