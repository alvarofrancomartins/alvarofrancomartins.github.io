Absolutely. 23rd is great. I teach my seminar that day at 1 but could tape in the morning or after class--in my 
office (very private), or at the Harvardx studios (less) or in the Woodberry poetry room (the nicest place). . If 
Woody wanted, we could bring some students into the taping or just do the two of us... 
Woody is absolutely welcome to come to the seminar, of course 
John McCain, Tony Kushner, Al Gore have all signed on the last 2 days...crazy

Jeffrey, 
For taping in Cambridge? For breakfast and taping at my house. Depends on what woody is up for. My ideal 
would be a 1/2 hour-40 minute conversation, but we could do a quick taping in 15 minutes ...my team can be 
ready 
And , just to remind,could also come to do taping in ny on 24th because I'm coming to New York the evening 
of 23rd for a YIVO event--to which you would both be most welcome I'm sure (YIVO is the largest collection 
of materials from Jewish Eastern Europe)

That was fun- definitely the highlight of a day that was not without other interesting moments 
Don't know which was better-- the wholly unexpected surprise reminder (by a prime minister) of my 
boyfriend from 1976( who was in high school, who lived with his doting parents), or , getting creamed on 
my producer's budget but then offered the opportunity to profess poetry for production funds . There may 
be someone as good in New York, but i'll never tell you and you really have a heck of a seminar table 
there . when do we do Whitman's "song of Myself" 1-15 Who else is reading with us? I'm ready . 
A few other follow ups : 
David and Brigid point out that reality tv doesn't cost anything because it is, as it sounds, very low 
budget . No writing , no special expertise or knowledge or research , no archival footage , no copyright 
clearance , no actors , no travel beyond the one location , certainly no clinton or woody allen or 
justice elena kagan or david brooks or Lena Dunham or even Professor New. That said , I think if were 
hiring the crew id do it for less -- probably 1, 250,000 all in . But I haven't won 10 Emmys and David 
has . That has value too. As does wgbh . But I'll be more prepared for the next conversation and want to 
be much more prepared for templeton, so thank you . 
really liked Michael. I would like to send him some stuff , but in googling him I noticed that we have 
the same birthday! May I have his email?

Jeffrey, if you are conceding any bit of the other things , with all due respect, that's exciting, as its new for me 
to be right about anything in the area of budgets. 
As it happens,and as of today, there is huge dissatisfaction in public television world with the lower budget 
Clinton footage versus the Herbie Hancock footage. David g was there for Herbie and not for Clinton. I can see 
the difference .the pilot was made for 100, 000, with savings on the Clinton but it does show

Subject: writing up proposal
From: lisa new
To: jeevacation@gmail.com
Direction: lisa new → jeevacation@gmail.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Jeffrey, 
Larry has told me that you and a friend would like to contribute to my project (hallelujah and thank you a 
million times, Jeffrey) and that I ought to write up a proposal asking for 500,000. This is wonderful. If this 
comes to pass, the best way for that money to come, I think, is as a gift to Poetry in America, an initiative at 
EdLabs at Harvard University. This will give me discretion over its disbursement to HarvardX and WGBH, but 
this will be absolutely be a Harvard gift that will count as Campaign success and from which Harvard will take 
some (but not as much)overhead. . So far the best finance people I've met are at EdLabs and they are happy to 
manage these funds for me. There are other ways to give me this money that leave Harvard out, but my 
understanding is that your friend would like this to be a Harvard gift. 
Here's a draft of what I'd like to do with that money. 
I'd like 500,000 to do post-production and distribution of a whole historical period of American poetry (1914-
1945 is what I'm thinking—Modernism) and including three episodes of tv. 
The raw materials for that period include interviews with Bill Clinton (including footage not yet used by 
WGBH), Peter Gallison, Walter Isaacson, Lena Dunham, Woody Allen (whose lawyers didn't like our release a 
while ago, but we're hoping will soften over time), Harrison Ford (still a maybe), Robert Polito, Sarah Kay, Al 
Filreis, Rafael Campo, Susan Howe, kids from Nantucket High School, kids from Brookline High 
School, Alfre Woodard, Jane Pickering, Jay Parini, Ray Dalio, Leon Wieseltier, Richard Dawkins and others; 
and footage shot in Harlem, Greenwich Village, midtown, Chicago, London (if I have the money to hire a crew 
there; don't now ), at museums including the Fogg, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Frost's house in Ripton 
Vermont and more. 
This allows the donor to give to a big Harvard Campaign priority, Teaching and Learning , by supporting Poetry 
in America, allowing me to produce the crucial segment of the online course with the highest (TV quality) 
production values and so also supplying higher quality video to WGBH as a way also to cut their costs. 
Currently, HarvardX skimps (on lighting, for instance--see the Bill Clinton interview) and while WGBH ladles 
money raised by others into everything. I have been pounding away at my friends at WGBH and I know that 
WGBH producer will work with HarvardX if they can give him footage of the right quality. . That is, we'll use 
HarvardX as the backlot for WGBH so as to squeeze three episodes out for 250. 
This proposal does not include experiments in schools or the curricular development into courses for teachers 
that you've seen in other (million dollar ) proposals. But the courses for teachers can't happen before the 
footage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the WGBH episodes, and so this funding 
will make all the rest possible. 
I can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think I have wrong. 
And I can attach a draft budget based on real Harvard numbers (what my Harvard video editor, producer, media 
manager cost) as well as a draft WGBH budget I'll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at a 
second stage. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028882 
Let me know what you think? And when are we reading Whitman together. Why don't we set a date for Feb 
when Poetry in America 3: Whitman is running online and we could screen a little video and then have a 
discussion around your table with you and some friends?

This proposal does not include experiments in schools or the curricular development into courses for teachers 
that you've seen in other (million dollar ) proposals. But the courses for teachers can't happen before the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028884 
footage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the WGBH episodes, and so this 
funding will make all the rest possible. 
I can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think I have wrong. 
And I can attach a draft budget based on real Harvard numbers (what my Harvard video editor, producer, 
media manager cost) as well as a draft WGBH budget I'll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at 
a second stage. 
Let me know what you think? And when are we reading Whitman together. Why don't we set a date for Feb 
when Poetry in America 3: Whitman is running online and we could screen a little video and then have a 
discussion around your table with you and some friends?

Dear Jeffrey, 
Apropos of our conversation of a few minutes ago, This proposal went to someone I thought was 
interested in the environment and science but who seems, in fact, far more interested in supporting TV 
on a broad range of topics. 
500,000 would fund this initiative as the second HGSE course (after Poetry of the City) and could begin 
immediately, Jan 1.. I'd be thrilled to include other scientists you name, perhaps taping the group in a 
session on metaphor at the edges of fields. 
INote that taped sessions already include economics, marine biology, astronomy, evolutionary biology, 
zoology, physics and computer science. Richard Dawkins, Walter Isaacson, David Mossberg and David 
Malan have all said yes to tapings. Footage for all the others is already shot and ready for post 
production. 
I am having a drink with Dean of Ed School today and can explore this with him among other topics

okay. you let me know when you can talk. 
And I hadn't added to this list neuroscience--where Emily Dickinson has it nailed-- and maybe this would be the 
right poem for your group. Notice how many metaphors are operating simultaneously here 
The Brain, within its Groove 
Runs evenly--and true--
But let a Splinter swerve--
'Twere easier for You--
To put a Current back--
When Floods have slit the Hills--
And scooped a Turnpike for Themselves--
And trodden out the Mills--
I get to New York Thursday am or perhaps tomorrow night...haven't decided quite yet which. Always 
prefer face to face if you have time

Subject: Poetry Update and Thank You
From: lisa new

Direction: lisa new → jeevacation@gmail.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Jeffrey, 
May I drop by before the New Year (perhaps on the 9th, or on the 17th or 18th?) to get your advice 
about my renewal of the Templeton campaign, and also my needs in the coming year for Poetry in 
America? Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the bottom a 
message just for you.... 
-Lisa 
That you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose 
support— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to 
realize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to 
produce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of 
humanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and informal, 
online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to 
begin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work. 
Whether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker's Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal 
sponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an elusive 
friend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or provided 
overnight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you highlighted 
our work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors; whether you 
flew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or asked your children's 
school to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation to take an interest in the 
project, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of finance, or of distribution; whether 
you praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you enabled what we have done. 
Here's what we have to report, and to show, a year later, thanks to your help. Links offer sneak peeks 
of works -in-progress across the full portfolio of Poetry in America projects. 
• The first eight-episode season of the public television series Poetry in America (a co-
production between WGBH, Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Grubin, and my own new 
production company, Verse Video), is now fully funded and in production, with episodes featuring Bill  
Clinton, Herbie Hancock and Sonia Sanchez on Langston Hughes, Frank Gehry on Carl Sandburg, 
Katie Couric on Elizabeth Bishop, Nas on Whitman, and many more scheduled for nationwide launch 
in 2017. 
• Poetry in America's many initiatives to reach Middle and High School teachers and their 
students are taking root. Our first online course for Middle and High School Teachers, Poetry of 
the City, will launch this Spring with the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Companion 
materials to this course will be made available for free on PBS LearningMedia. This course is 
designed to meet the needs of English Language Arts and Social Studies teachers in the US and 
internationally. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028943 
• We are eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for 
Middle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language Arts 
instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural world, 
conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the field with 
great teachers. 
• A recent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network 
of charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready 
educational material on The Poetry of Art Sport, and Play. This collection will include discussions 
on poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature dancers, 
athletes, fashion designers, and more. 
• With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems, 
we are eager to expand our reach and move into America's schools, disseminating, testing, 
and learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work 
evaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to 
produce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth. 
Working closely with such partners as The Nantucket Project, Nautilus Magazine, The Aspen Ideas 
Festival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard's provider of free open online 
courses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and 
lifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky's  
"Shirt" (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part 
Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries. 
Growing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a 
fundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We've taken a 
big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our website— to 
launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and educational projects. 
We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch! 
Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The Leon 
Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff I desperately needed to 
complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set down 
a solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public 
humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they 
heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts and 
Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video 
production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in 
producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard students. 
My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our collection 
for PBS LeamingMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the most 
consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year that 
make future projects that much more likely. If I can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling these 
coffers, I will be that much more able to keep working. 
I am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help 
you have offered to give in bringing them around. I have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten 
funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test, that 
video in schools as I proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where I could 
also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their character 
criteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe Biden had 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028944 
agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the platform and the 
name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building literacy and 
character in the schools. 
It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking 
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it's always annoying but I always learn. 
With abundant gratitude, 
Lisa

Dear Jeffrey, 
May I drop by before the New Year (perhaps on the 9th, or on the 17th or 18th?) to get your advice 
about my renewal of the Templeton campaign, and also my needs in the coming year for Poetry in 
America? Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the bottom a 
message just for you.... 
-Lisa 
That you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose 
support— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to 
realize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to 
produce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of 
humanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and informal, 
online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to 
begin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work. 
Whether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker's Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal 
sponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an 
elusive friend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or 
provided overnight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you 
highlighted our work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors; 
whether you flew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or asked 
your children's school to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation to take an 
interest in the project, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of finance, or of 
distribution; whether you praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you enabled what we 
have done. 
Here's what we have to report, and to show, a year later, thanks to your help. Links offer sneak 
peeks of works -in-progress across the full portfolio of Poetry in America projects. 
• The first eight-episode season of the public television series Poetry in America (a co-
production between WGBH, Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Grubin, and my own new 
production company, Verse Video), is now fully funded and in production, with episodes featuring  
Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock and Sonia Sanchez on Langston Hughes, Frank Gehry on Carl 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028946 
Sandburg, Katie Couric on Elizabeth Bishop, Nas on Whitman, and many more scheduled for 
nationwide launch in 2017. 
• Poetry in America's many initiatives to reach Middle and High School teachers and their 
! I students are taking root. Our first online course for Middle and High School Teachers, Poetry of 
the City, will launch this Spring with the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Companion 
materials to this course will be made available for free on PBS LearningMedia. This course is 
designed to meet the needs of English Language Arts and Social Studies teachers in the US and 
internationally. 
• We are eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for 
Middle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language 
Arts instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural  
world, conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the 
field with great teachers. 
• A recent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network 
of charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready 
educational material on The Poetry of Art Sport, and Play. This collection will include discussions 
on poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature dancers, 
athletes, fashion designers, and more. 
• With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems, 
we are eager to expand our reach and move into America's schools, disseminating, testing, 
and learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work 
evaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to 
produce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth. 
Working closely with such partners as The Nantucket Project, Nautilus Magazine, The Aspen Ideas 
Festival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard's provider of free open online 
courses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and 
lifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky's  
"Shirt" (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part 
Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries. 
Growing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a 
fundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We've taken 
a big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our 
website— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and 
educational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch! 
Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The 
Leon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff I desperately needed to 
complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set 
down a solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public 
humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they 
heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts 
and Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video 
production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in 
producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard students. 
My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our collection 
for PBS LeamingMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the most 
consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028947 
make future projects that much more likely. If I can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling these 
coffers, I will be that much more able to keep working. 
I am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help 
you have offered to give in bringing them around. I have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten 
funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test, 
that video in schools as I proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where I 
could also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their 
character criteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe 
Biden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the 
platform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building 
literacy and character in the schools. 
It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking 
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it's always annoying but I always learn. 
With abundant gratitude,

Dear Jeffrey, 
Woody has received from his lawyer some questions I asked in in response to the agreement Irwin Tenenbaum 
sent me... .1 found that that agreement generous and reasonable (!), and I'm excited to go forward, but I do need 
those clarifications. We can absolutely agree that we will not give Woody larger or more important billing than 
Bill Clinton or Joe Biden, and that I'd like to come to him to renew our agreement after five years. 
The Harvard week of content in which Woody will appear, if we can sign this, needs to be edited in the next 
week-10 days. We are out of time, which is why I'm writing 
The television show has been picked up by American Public Television, they will distribute nationally, and 
they've asked for another 5 episodes. I so want Woody to be one of those. 
I'd like to see the haiku written by computer. Haiku is not that hard. I'd like to see an elegy written by 
computer.

Subject: Thank You from Lisa and Poetry in America
From: lisa new
To: jeevacation@gmail.com
Direction: lisa new → jeevacation@gmail.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear 
Jeffrey 
(and please see note at bottom), 
This end-of-the-year letter is to catch you up on developments and to report progress made in 2016 
by Poetry in America, by its associated non-profit production company, Verse Video Education, and 
by (and with) our new Harvard partner, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. Whether 
you are a longstanding adviser and supporter of Poetry in America, or you've more recently joined our 
circle of proponents, your contributions, thought partnership and enthusiasm have made this year's 
successes possible. 
Last fall, I knew this would be a crucial year. Goals for 2016 included moving our co-produced 
television series, Poetry in America, toward a concrete release date (now entering post-production, 
we launch nationwide in April 2018), converting our six HarvardX MOOC modules into for-credit 
courses (now complete and being offered by Harvard's Division of Continuing Education), and getting 
the word out on our first course developed especially for K-12 educators, Poetry in America for 
Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop. With a mission of creating and distributing the highest-
quality humanities content for a wide variety of learners, our projects now rely on a salaried 
production staff of five, a rotating corps of part timers and contractors, and a growing cohort of 
Harvard graduate students, undergraduates and interns whom we train in the public-facing 
humanities. Growing fast, in 2016 we more firmly established Verse Video Education as a nimble and 
stable producer of humanities-based content (now including an archive of over 120 separate 
interviews with distinguished discussants), while also defining a forward-looking partnership and 
growth strategy with Harvard. As 2016 draws to a close, I have much progress to report. 
Verse Video Education: Independent 501c3 
In April 2016, Verse Video Education, the fledgling production company I'd founded in 2014, received 
IRS approval and became a 501c3. Now capable of accepting philanthropic contributions, Verse 
Video Education has also begun to generate revenue by producing high-quality educational media for 
other institutions. Clients within our first year included Greenwich Country Day School, YIVO Institute 
for Jewish Research, Schlesinger Library, Harvard Institute for Global Health, and Project Zero. While 
philanthropic donations remain essential, work for clients allows us to amplify the impact of 
philanthropic donations, not only permitting additional investment in our flagship partnerships with 
WGBH and Harvard, but also fostering development of new partnerships and projects. These include 
a video series on poetry and science now running with award-winning magazine Nautilus, a 
collaboration with distinguished poet Robert Pinsky and his Favorite Poem Project, and an expansion 
of our poetry film series with partners at The Nantucket Project. Advised by a stellar and diversely 
talented board, Verse Video Education is looking toward sustainability. We are now discussing 
distribution of new content with a variety of stakeholders, including media providers in China. 
New Harvard Partner: Bok Center for Teaching and Learning 
Meanwhile, Poetry in America has deepened its partnership and formulated a plan for growth going 
forward at Harvard. This fall, Harvard's Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Mike Smith, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019203 
endorsed the integration and expansion of my public-facing humanities work within the Derek Bok 
Center for Teaching and Learning. As a Bok Fellow this year, and alongside Bok director Rob Lue in 
the years to come, I will be working to substantially expand Bok's capacity and resources to train 
humanists in 21st-century methods of public engagement-- developing courses, digital fellowship 
opportunities and also securing distribution outlets and partners for content produced in Bok by 
Harvard humanists. By next year at this time, I will be turning some of my attention beyond poetry (my 
favorite, but hardly the only humanistic mode of communication!) to create a wider base of 
humanities materials for use in American schools and other institutions. We will begin integrating and 
anchoring Poetry in America content (on art, sport and play; on the environment; and on health and 
well being) with content created by others. As I continue to experiment with use of digital media 
within my residential courses for undergraduates and graduates, I shall also be working with other 
faculty and graduate students. My work at Bok will also facilitate collaborations between humanists 
working across the whole university. Projects for 2017 include work with HarvardX on drama and 
Shakespeare, with Harvard's Center for the Environment, with the Arts and Humanities Initiative at 
Harvard Medical School, and with several programs within Harvard's Graduate School of Education. 
Launching in 2017: Our First Course Designed Specifically for Teachers 
Verse Video Education has allocated much of its staff time this year to bringing its first course 
designed specifically to support the American secondary classroom to completion. Poetry in America 
for Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop draws on assets created at HarvardX, along with 
footage captured with our TV partners and independently by Verse Video Education. The resulting 
course, designed for English, Social Studies, and Arts teachers, as well as for librarians, 
administrators and others, provides deep content instruction as well as pedagogical training. 
Common Core aligned, this course, the first of its kind, is now open for enrollment, and will launch 
January 23rd. We are currently discussing group enrollments with major educational systems and 
reformers across the nation, and we are also raising scholarship funds for strapped enrollees. Over 
time, we hope to play a leading role in improving literacy and in strengthening the humanities across 
the American educational landscape. 
Airing Nationwide in 2018: Poetry in America, The Television Series 
In May 2016, Verse Video Education was asked by WGBH and American Public Television to expand 
its television series in development from 8 to 13 episodes, listed below. 
The following episodes are entering post-production: 
On Edward Hirsch's "Fast Break": Shaquille O'Neal, Pau Gasol, Shane Battier, Edward Hirsch, 
and an on-court pick-up basketball chorus filmed at Success Academy Charter School; On W.H. 
Auden's "Musee Des Beaux Arts": Ambassador Samantha Power, David Brooks, Peter Sacks; On 
Robert Hayden's "Those Winter Sundays": Vice President Joe Biden, Elizabeth Alexander, Angela 
Duckworth, Kevin Young, and a chorus of fathers and sons; On Carl Sandburg's "Skyscraper": 
Frank Gehry, Robert Polito, and a chorus of Young Student Poets; On Nas's "New York State of 
Mind": Nas, Russell Simmons, Salamishah Tillet, Steve Stoute, and a chorus of hip hop heads; On 
Galway Kinnell's "The Grey Heron": E.O. Wilson, Robert Hass, Laura McPhee; On Gwendolyn 
Brooks's "To Prisoners": Anna Deveare Smith, Reginald Dwayne Betts, Li-Young Lee and a 
chorus of exonerees from the Innocence Project; On William Carlos Williams's "This Is Just To 
Say": Woody Allen, Jane Hirshfield, Rafael Campo and a chorus of couples young and old; On 
Langston Hughes's "Harlem": President Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock, Sonia Sanchez and a chorus 
of children from Promise Academy; On Allen Ginsberg's Hymmnn from "Kaddish" and "Hum 
Bom": Bono, Juan Felipe Herrera and a chorus of clergy. 
The production of the following episodes will wrap early 2017: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019204 
On Emily Dickinson's "I cannot dance opon my Toes": Cynthia Nixon, Yo Yo Ma, Marie Howe 
and Bill T. Jones; On Marianne Moore's "The Fish": Jorie Graham, Edward Norton, Conservation 
International scientists, and the passengers and crew of oceanographic vessel The Alucia; On 
Elizabeth Bishop's "One Art" or Edna St. Vincent Millay's "Four Sonnets." 
Jeffrey, 
Just a quick note to thank you again for all the help you've given me. The generous contribution you 
made last year to Verse Video Education is now in use (we've hired our new editor!). Once he helps 
us to plow through the work of this year, we'll begin to look forward to crafting educational content on 
the literature of art, sport and play (these materials now including footage from recent shoots with 
Shaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Cynthia Nixon, Bono and others). 100K makes so much possible. 
But, of course, you've also been a key preceptor as I've learned how --squirming all the way--the 
sausage really gets made in public television. I can't say I've been entirely successful in taming costs 
there, but I've been far better armed and more mindful of what they should be after the stern tutorial 
you administered. 
Whenever Templeton might be ready to evaluate another application, I'm ready for another proposal 
for them. I wonder if you might arrange a meeting for me with the famous Bamaby? I can't yet afford a 
grant writer, and so the time one of these suckers takes makes me think doing more advance 
reconnaissance is crucial. Would he meet with me? Kosher? I'd also love to meet with the Blacks as I 
get closer to making content on theatre. I hope that Debra is well. 
And heard there's another little Jeff in the caribbean...

you are a longstanding adviser and supporter of Poetry in America, or you've more recently joined 
our circle of proponents, your contributions, thought partnership and enthusiasm have made this 
year's successes possible. 
Last fall, I knew this would be a crucial year. Goals for 2016 included moving our co-produced 
television series, Poetry in America, toward a concrete release date (now entering post-production, 
we launch nationwide in April 2018), converting our six HarvardX MOOC modules into for-credit 
courses (now complete and being offered by Harvard's Division of Continuing Education), and 
getting the word out on our first course developed especially for K-12 educators, Poetry in America  
for Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop. With a mission of creating and distributing the 
highest-quality humanities content for a wide variety of learners, our projects now rely on a salaried 
production staff of five, a rotating corps of part timers and contractors, and a growing cohort of 
Harvard graduate students, undergraduates and interns whom we train in the public-facing 
humanities. Growing fast, in 2016 we more firmly established Verse Video Education as a nimble 
and stable producer of humanities-based content (now including an archive of over 120 separate 
interviews with distinguished discussants), while also defining a forward-looking partnership and 
growth strategy with Harvard. As 2016 draws to a close, I have much progress to report.

from barnaby - 
she could apply, but she should know that there are only a few grants in each round; most projects proposed 
don't get funding. It is like rolling the dice. what people don't understand is that many grants are not funded not 
because they are defective in any way, but simply because there is not enough funding to cover even a part of 
what comes in (there are thousands of applications and hundreds of millions of dollars of requests that go all 
through different kinds of review; it is hard to know what will make it through because different people make 
the priority decisions at different stages of review; and it depends what other applications are in the pool in a 
given cycle). There is no "direct" route anymore.

can you give me a little bit of phrasing you think is optimal? I'm not sure I know how to ask her to join this 
company without asking her to be 
part of poetry in america. It does also seem to me perhaps relevant that Serena thinks of herself as a poetry 
person. 
For people who think that way, maybe not nothing (hasn't been nothing to others) that a Harvard poetry 
professor seeks her wisdom on the art form? 
Would really appreciate your edit.

I'm going upstairs to hunt for my copy of Lolita, or will get on my kindle and reread on our way to 
Australia. I may have lent it to one of my kids. I would recommend reading My Antonia by Cather next 
time you're on a long plane trip. The prose is gorgeous, and the book has-- come to think of it-- similar 
themes to Lolita in that it's about a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a young 
girl.

Thank you for this help with Serena. I'm so sorry about what happened with WA. I will keep the

Dear Jeffrey, 
Here is an invitation you can forward. Fingers crossed. 
I'm going upstairs to hunt for my copy of Lolita, or will get on my kindle and reread on our way to 
Australia. I may have lent it to one of my kids. I would recommend reading My Antonia by Cather next 
time you're on a long plane trip. The prose is gorgeous, and the book has-- come to think of it-- similar 
themes to Lolita in that it's about a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a young 
girl. 
Thank you for this help with Serena. I'm so sorry about what happened with WA. I will keep the "bootleg" 
episode and hope to release someday. It's so good, and he was so kind to read the poem with me and you 
were so kind to make it happen.
