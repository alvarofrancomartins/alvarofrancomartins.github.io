Lets have a chat -- you do need to fight back some how. Present evidence that she is lying AND show 
the world that you are no longer that guy. You have made changes -- and that this is the past. My 
sense is that its TV type thing where you just talk honestly about this/present evidence that its not 
true/ and focus on what you have been doing for past five years. Charlie Rose? 
But you cant just sit there taking punches like this -- especially wen the British tabs are driving this. 
Maybe you go on British TV.... 
Call me any time.

surfaced.. I thought it right as a friend to protect her name. however during the entire time she 
was my serious girlfriend. She traveled with me almost everywhere, each house, she is on the plane many 
many times. she knew and remembers She never saw anything that claims. She can 
confirm 1. I was never alone at the house. staff, friends etc. , no girl ever complained, not once. 2. jane doe 
1 and 2 , were local strippers, that would call all the time asking if they could do massages. . . they left message 
after message. 3. We had a serious love relationship, I had promised her not to involve her in my story as it 
was so sordid. . she was 22 - 24 at the time. . 4 she has photos after photos showing we were together. . 5 she

I think the big issue is separating yourself from Andrew. I mean I can see why a statement might help 
in some way -- but its Andrew (not clinton and the rest) that is keeping the story alive. Until you are 
able to come forward and address that the story lives on. I mean in the end he had consensual sex 
with M. And Mworked for you. The rest is atmospherics. You have moved on! People don't know 
that and cant accept that unless you say as much. 
Does franc drama worry you? Am writing on it now...

never surfaced.. I thought it right as a friend to protect her name. however during the entire 
time she was my serious girlfriend. She traveled with me almost everywhere, each house, she is on 
the plane many many times. she knew and remembers She never saw anything that 
claims. She can confirm 1. I was never alone at the house. staff, friends etc. , no girl ever complained, 
not once. 2. jane doe 1 and 2 , were local strippers, that would call all the time asking if they could do 
massages. . . they left message after message. 3. We had a serious love relationship, I had promised her 
not to involve her in my story as it was so sordid. . she was 22 - 24 at the time. . 4 she has photos after 
photos showing we were together. . 5 she knows clinton was never on the island. 6 she knows no sex with 
steven hawking, she knows no sex with ehud as he was also never on the island. 6 she is 38 years old now 
and presentable. . 7 She woudl acknowledge that these girls asked to bring their friends . many of their 
best friends sat in the kitchen while they gave massages outside on the terrace. ( no sex ). . they certainly 
looked over age. nevr heard anyone say otherwise. , Jeffrey never asked for underage, that is crazy, . . 8 . 
answered the phones. served coffee. . there were many massage people , men women, aged up to 
60.

In response to a message left seeking the Trump campaign's comment on this article, on 
Thursday Trump's general counsel Alan Garten emailed threatening legal action against 
BuzzFeed News. "Mr. Trump's only connection with Mr. Epstein was that Mr. Epstein was 
one of thousands of people who has visited Mar-a-Lago. That's it. Mr. Trump has NEVER 
been accused of having any involvement or even having any knowledge of any of Mr. 
Epstein's conduct by anyone," Garten wrote. 
"As a result, I have no idea what the purpose of your article could possibly be other than to 
try and intentionally and with actual malice defame my client's name and reputation by 
mentioning him in the same article as Mr. Epstein. In other words, suggest guilt by

"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy," Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is 
even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about 
it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life." 
That story will never die.

Keep getting calls from that guy doing a book on you -- John Connolly. He seems very interested in 
your relationship with the news media. I told him you were a hell of a guy:) One oddity: he said he had 
been told that that quote from Trump about you in the original NY Mag story had been manufactured. 
ie, that I did not actually speak to Donald. Which is bull shit of course. I am sure that is what Trump 
told him as they have been getting a lot of questions from reporters about you. 
He actually seemed to be a sensible guy/solid reporter -- just from the few conversations I had with 
him. I think he is close to finishing up. 
Did you ever speak to him?

A new guy for your stable of smart guys. He taught at SAIS in DC where I went in 1989. I was just 
down there a few weeks ago and was on a panel with him. He is vicious on Bill C's NATO expansion --
biggest foreign policy error since WWII. Retiring. Let me know if you want an intro -- I am sure that 
your Russian friends would enjoy talking to him. Book well worth reading...

Subject: Responding to yesterday's election 
To: 
> 
Dear Packer Families, 
Like many of you, I am writing this message on very little sleep. Last night was like no other in our 
political memory, defying the predictions of the most erudite pundits and political 
prognosticators. 
Today, we are spending a great deal of time unpacking the election results with our students 
across the three divisions — during morning meeting and throughout the day in Lower School 
classrooms, in Middle School advisories, during Upper School Community time, as well as in 
many individual classroom conversations. I write to assure you that we will do our best to handle 
these discussions with balance, sensitivity, and fairness. 
Given that last week's mock election among Packer's Upper School students showed that over 
8o% favored Secretary Clinton, I don't think it's a huge leap to assume that there was more 
disappointment than joy in Packer households as results unfolded last night. At the same time, 
there are certainly Packer families who support Mr. Trump and are pleased with this outcome. As 
a school community, we have an obligation to recognize that there will be a broad array of feelings 
generated by the election results, and it is our responsibility as a school to make space for these 
feelings to be expressed thoughtfully and compassionately, as well as to model the tolerance and 
acceptance of difference that are among our core values. No doubt, we have our work cut out for 
us, but I am confident in the good that we can do as a community. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033189 
There are abundant lessons to be learned from this election: that experts can be wrong; that our 
country is even more deeply divided than many of us had thought; and that abundant numbers of 
our fellow Americans feel a deep sense of despair and disaffection with the status quo of 
government. For us here at school, we will use this as an opportunity to talk with your children in 
age-appropriate ways about demographics, the economy, social policy, our democratic system, 
and the rule of law. We will also talk about the world's response to yesterday's election results, our 
individual responsibilities as citizens to continue to give voice to our beliefs, and appropriate 
channels of political activism. On a more basic level, we will stress the importance of not being a 
gloating winner or a sore loser, and about the strength of our nation, its history of responding to 
dramatic political change, and the hopefulness of the future. 
As for you, our families, I offer two resources. Last week at a NYSAIS heads-of-school conference 
that I attended, the University of Pennsylvania educator Ali Michael spoke about advancing our 
national dialogue about race. This morning Dr. Michael wrote a Huffington Post piece, "What Do  
We Tell the Children?", a moving yet direct reminder of how we, as adults, can model our 
responses for the young people around us. Next Wednesday, November 16, from 6:3o to 8 
p.m., Semeka Smith-Williams and the PA Diversity Committee are holding a "Post-
Election Healing" evening here at Packer. 
Please reach out if you have questions, suggestions, or simply would like to share your thoughts, 
and take good care. 
Best regards. 
Bruce L. Dennis

Any further intel on Treasury? Priebus choice suggests to me that he may go for a bigger name in 
treasury than Mnuchin. Someone to underscore/push forward this notion that he is Reagan 2.0 (as 
some are suggesting). I am just not sure who that person would be. The Trump trade certainly seems 
to have legs -- all the Hillary loving hedgies I am talking to are congratulating themselves for making 
so much money last week. They are all Trump lovers now!

yeah, but that was a smart move -- made him look presidential. everything he has done so far suggests 
to me he is going to do what you told me months ago: appoint competent people beneath him who he 
trusts AND who will not fuck things up. Christie was not one of those people.

EUROPEAN MULTI ASSET COVERAGE MEETING IMPRESSIONS: Eyes on Real Money outflows; 
Christmas comes early for most of macro players, hedge funds. Absolute majority bet on HRC to win, but 
majority still made good money because Hillary bets worked as Trump trades. 
Wider, steeper core rates, stronger USD, weaker EM is the Rage. The last one, EM, is the big loser out of 
Trump Reflation Theme. DM over EM and divergence within DM are very much in vogue. All gains of EMBI 
since March are gone! 
For Rates & FX, it does feel like early days of Taper Tantrum trade of 3 years ago. Both dominated by US price 
action. In both, hedge funds have now caught the moves, play offense & ride the Trump narrative. Real Money 
is on the ropes, caught long Fixed Income/duration/carry and cannot play defense fearing Outflows. 
In Emerging Markets, most outflows are retail, ETF driven. All eyes on next leg of institutions. In equities, 
banks big winners; FANGs losing. I asked partners 2 questions. 1) Would the "this will be great for business, 
feel good factor" wave out-run "if real yields go up, equities are a sell" fear. Clients are torn, but the former, 
bullish camp wins for now, my colleagues suggest. There are skeptics though. 
2) In Europe, do fears over Renzi losing & Le Pen winning climb over the big momentum behind banks etc. 
Again, my equity team suggests, "no, reflation wave may win over Italy referendum anxiety„ for now." Renzi is 
now widely expected to lose, so a "yes" would be the big surprise trade. And the bigger elephant in the room is 
Le Pen. If she wins in May, Europe as we know it may really shake.. But for now this is more in the radars of 
Euro & EBG traders. 
Core rates are driven by the speed of TY sell-off. And in G5 FX, the big driver is USD/JPY. The stronger "we 
should believe in Trump reflation narrative" winds are, the more USD/JPY buyers we see. 
Some in Research warn that Trump may succeed in "tax cuts, faster than any infrastructure spending," but few 
macro are in mood to listen. A few players believe, looking at trade weights of each with US and magnitude of 
sell-off, Asia FX may have more weakness to come than MXN. Will copper/infrastructure rally eventually help 
Chile? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023635 
Most macro love NKY, willing to love it more. Bringing it home; fast macro money players are rushing to erase 
losses, year long pains through wider rates, longer USD, weaker EM, stronger equities. 
Real Money is in defensive, remembering Taper Tantrum days, fearing institutional outflows & forced selling 
of carry hope positions. 
Those who want to "fade" Trump rally, seek valuation in EM, believe core rates can tighten to get a breather are 
in Minority.

My Thoughts on Currencies 
Stephen L Jen (London) 
November 29, 2016 
Bottom line. Some retracement in the market trends we've seen since 
November 8 makes sense, in light of the magnitudes of the moves as well as 
the upcoming event risks (Italian referendum, OPEC meeting, and the 
FOMC meeting). But I think none of these events will likely surprise the 
markets, and President-Elect Trump will likely continue to drive the 
markets, extending the recent trends. By the way, he has left the US 
Treasury Secretary post last to be filled, and it is the most important 
appointment for the markets as it will both reflect and influence key policies 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026637 
on trade, tax cuts, and infrastructure spending. (1) The doves at the Fed 
have been silenced as, under President Trump, the US policy mix will likely 
be less lop-sided and the emphasis will be on Arrow 3, with Arrow 1 being 
downgraded. I think the effective demotion of the Fed has just begun. Its 
independence will likely be challenged, as it should be, in my personal 
view. November 8 marked the beginning of the end of the financial 
repression in the US. (2) Generating outsized economic growth will be key 
to settling several important inconsistencies in macro. I will elaborate on 
this point below. But the market trends witnessed since November 8 will 
not be sustained unless Mr Trump's policies indeed lead to significantly 
higher nominal GDP growth. (3) The mainstream media remain negative on 
Mr Trump, but this will keep the hurdle low, and in turn pressure President 
Trump to deliver early in 2017 and thus for him to impress favourably. A 
shift away from identity politics, in my view, based on my personal 
experience from Taiwan, should lead to positive economic 
progress. Investors won't need to wait long for there to be more concrete 
announcements on the various parts of Arrow 3, including both the content 
of the policies as well as their sequencing. (4) FWIW, my two policy 
recommendations to the reformers are (i) design an effective global taxation 
scheme to properly tax multi-national corporations and (ii) adopt industrial 
policies to help countries focus on their comparative advantages. The US, 
UK, Japan, and Italy are all prime candidates to do (ii). (5) The dollar is 
already moderately over-valued, but this will not prevent it from 
strengthening further, especially against the EM currencies. Think in terms 
of 'growth alpha' and 'growth beta.' Much of EM, including China since 
February of this year, have not possessed 'growth alpha' and have continued 
to rely on 'growth beta' vis-à-vis the rest of the world. I struggle to think of 
key reforms that EM countries have embarked on in recent years: even 
countries like France and Italy have undertaken more reforms than most EM 
countries. Squeezed by (i) a more hawkish Fed, (ii) a China that will 
continue to soft land, and (iii) a potentially more inward-looking US, EM 
will struggle without 'growth alpha.' I think we may be entering into a 
period of differentiation among the EM markets: those that have 'growth 
alpha' will be rewarded while those that continue to rely on 'growth beta' 
will not. (6) The world according to Trump will be more Darwinian for 
countries and less Darwinian for US citizens.This notion applies to investing 
in EM, to countries' growth prospects, and to international competition — 
(potentially) very different from the last few years, when 'the Fed was the 
only game in town' and everyone and everything floated higher by central 
bank liquidity... In any case, the dollar should be in a good position to 
thrive, I think. 
Economic Olympics. The markets are no longer driven only by the Fed and 
central bank policies, but by forward-looking policy inclinations. The 'false 
economy' that central banks have nurtured will gradually be replaced by real 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026638 
economies. In my view, Mr Trump's victory will have many social, 
geopolitical, and economic consequences, but for investors I think he will 
start a period of 'Economic Olympics', whereby the federal governments 
around the world will take more responsibility and be more proactive to help 
their 'national teams' to become more competitive in this globalised 
world. (1) Free trade is in theory good for economic growth. But there are 
other policies (such as well-directed R&D, efficient investment, an effective 
educational system) that are also extremely important for long-term growth, 
but have been ignored in the past 15 years because of the globalisation 
fad. A slowdown in trade globalisation might not be bad for the global 
economy, if policy makers replace this engine of growth with other 
structural improvements. But while globalisation is more about 'growth 
beta', other types of structural reforms are about 'growth alpha' and 
federal/central governments around the world will need to make a greater 
effort at leading the economies to prevent them from falling behind. This is 
like a government-led program to win Olympic medals, without doping by 
central banks. (2) A client kindly brought to my attention an interesting 
report done by the Harvard Business School that touches on the idea 
mentioned above (Problems Unsolved and a Nation Divided: the State of 
US Competitiveness 2016'). In it, several sensible and consequential points 
were made: 'The pressing need for a national economic strategy... Given 
the significant challenges facing the American economy, the U.S. needs a 
national economic strategy more than at any other time in recent history. A 
strategy is an integrated set of priorities that builds on strengths while 
acknowledging and tackling weaknesses... The U.S. lacks an economic 
strategy, especially at the federal level. The implicit strategy has been to 
trust the Federal Reserve to solve our problems through monetary 
policy... A national economic strategy for the U.S. will require action by 
business, state and local governments, and the federal government. All 
three levels have a crucial role to play in restoring competitiveness... Taking 
leadership in improving U.S. competitiveness is a pressing imperative for 
business leaders. _Many companies have failed to invest enough in 
improving the business environments in the regions in which they 
operate...' This report from the HBS also reiterates some recommendations 
they made in 2012: `[Our] Eight-Point Plan consists of the following policy 
recommendations: simplift the corporate tax code with lower statutory rates 
and no loopholes; move to a territorial tax system like all other leading 
nations '; ease the immigration of highly-skilled individuals; aggressively 
address distortions and abuses in the international trading system; improve 
logistics, communications, and energy infrastructure; simplift and 
streamline regulation; create a sustainable federal budget, including reform 
of entitlements; and responsibly develop America's unconventional energy 
advantage.' Interestingly, Mr Trump has discussed many of the same 
points. I personally think that, so far, identity politics has distracted from his 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026639 
message on economic reform. It is likely, I believe, that the focus of the 
general public will be moved to these critical economic reforms. (3) I repeat 
a point I've made in the past, that because the mainstream media and most 
scholars are still so skeptical of Mr Trump's policies, the hurdle for him to 
clear and impress positively is very low. Ironically, such general hostility 
will probably work in favour of the Trump Administration. 5 days after the 
surprise election victory, the press declared that Mr Trump's transition plan 
was in hopeless disarray, only for Mr Trump to announce one cabinet 
appointment every day — ahead of the schedule of Presidents Obama and Bill 
Clinton when they got elected. (4) We will likely see a less radical President 
Trump. We have already seen this on various issues (the Wall, prosecuting 
Ms Clinton), and my guess is that the trade policy will be more restrictive, 
but the changes will be nuanced at the same time. The appointment of the 
next Treasury Secretary will convey an important message. (5) I personally 
think that various countries will likely adopt industrial policies, as a 
substitute for slower trade globalization. Already, the UK's PM May 
announced an ambitious industrial strategy, with a focus on technology. The 
government is committed to investing in R&D through the Industrial 
Strategy Challenge Fund. Regular readers of our work should also know 
that that is what I would recommend for Japan to consider. I just came back 
from a trip to Singapore, and understand that the government there is also 
struggling to find the best strategy to deal with the next phase of economic 
development, now that the growth model based on trade and finance may be 
coming to an end. I think the US should also contemplate its own industrial 
policy. The title of this section is 'economic Olympics' to convey the notion 
that the world is in competition, not just along the axes of cheapness of 
labour and technology. There are different disciplines (analogous to the 
various sports in Olympics) in which any country can excel, if the efforts are 
appropriately focused. Instead of being mediocre in many events, countries 
should seek to win the gold medal in their best events... 
5%-plus nominal GDP growth in the US in 2017? There are several 
inconsistencies in the market trends: (1) a strong dollar and strong US 
equities; (2) protectionism and a strong dollar (Mexico, for example, has 
gotten 10% cheaper so far this month, and China is also cheaper. The 
greater the threats of protectionism against these countries, the cheaper are 
their costs of production...); (3) higher yields and strong equities; (4) Mr 
Trump does not like Chair Yellen or the Fed but he still needs and prefers 
low interest rates. The only variable that can address these inconsistencies is 
3-4% real economic growth and 5%-plus nominal GDP growth in the 
US. While it is unlikely that 5% nominal GDP growth is sustained over 
time, the atmospherics will stop the talk about `r-star' and help support 
interest rates in the US. 2017 may very well see 5%-plus nominal GDP 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026640 
growth, and, in the event, the 10Y UST yield at 2.34% would not seem too 
high. 
The dollar will continue to smile. Previously, we made the suggestion that 
the US dollar is on the right side of the Dollar Smile against the majors, but 
it is on the left side of the Dollar Smile against the EM 
currencies. Reaganomics-Lite should be positive for the dollar, even if the 
US' twin deficits could widen. 'America First' means that there will be a 
bifurcation in economic prosperity, that economic strength in the US will no 
longer translate, with the same elasticities as before, into prosperity in many 
parts of EM. (1) The dollar has begun a consolidation phase this week. But 
my guess is that it will be temporary and shallow, partly because the data 
(ISM and NFPRs) will be sufficiently strong to justify another Fed rate hike 
on December 14. The weekly claims data remain extraordinarily strong, 
while the second derivatives in the data in much of EM have ceased to be 
positive. (2) Further advances in the dollar, however, will of course depend 
on the policy announcements and delivery by the Trump Administration, as 
well as an apparent lack of an economic strategy in other countries. (3) 
Yield differentials have helped the dollar advance vis-à-vis the JPY and the 
EUR. However, I should note that the EMU economies are not doing that 
badly, though credit demand remains weak. PMI remains well above 50 and 
inflation has bounced away from zero. The main factor — other than yield 
differentials - weighing on the EUR is the risk that we will see more political 
uncertainty in Europe. (4) I came across an editorial arguing that Mr 
Trump's protectionist policies would hurt the dollar's international 
standing. While this may be a popular view — that the US, as a savings 
deficit nation, needs a globalised world to finance its external balance —I 
contest this conclusion. I think it will be extremely difficult for the 
international status of the dollar to be supplanted, even with Mr Trump as 
the President. The dollar losing its hegemonic status has been a popular 
thesis by many academics over the last twenty years — precisely the period 
when the dollar's international and reserve currency status has risen. In 
many ways, the sturdiness of the dollar's global status has surprised some 
people, because globalisation is supposed to lead to a multi-polar world 
where the US loses its dominance. That is certainly true for the real 
economy, but exactly the opposite has happened for the dollar. This is a 
point I've tried hard to make over the years, that financial globalisation is 
uni-polar, even though trade globalisation is multi-polar. Look at how the 
rise in the dollar is hurting, disproportionately, the high-yield and EM 
currencies. Further, which currencies might replace the dollar? The EUR 
itself is still in an existential crisis; nothing needs to be said about the JPY; 
China could not even dare opening up its capital account. In fact, Beijing 
has just issued even more 'strict controls' on overseas investment, after 
experiencing some USD207 billion in outflows in Q3 2016. Just because 
President Trump's prospective trade policy may not be politically correct 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026641 
does not imply that there will be a demise of the dollar, or that fewer people 
in the world would speak English in protest. If anything, I'm worried that a 
sharp rally in the dollar could trigger another financial crisis in EM... Don't 
get me wrong, I do not believe the dominance of the dollar is good for the 
global financial/monetary system. But it is a trend that is difficult to reverse, 
unless the structural integrity of the EUR is enhanced, and the foundations of 
the RMB market are improved. Increasing returns to scale have made 
English/dollar popular, and it will be increasingly difficult to challenge their 
roles as the world internationalizes. (5) The BIS recently published an 
interesting and important paper (`The Dollar, Bank Leverage and the 
Deviation from Covered Interest Parity,' by H.S. Shin et al., BIS WP 592) 
on how a stronger dollar could lead to a tightening in lending conditions in 
the rest of the world, including EM. ' 111 he value of the dollar plays the role 
of a barometer of risk-taking capacity in capital markets. In particular, it is 
the spot exchange rate of the dollar which plays a crucial role... [7] he 
strength of the dollar is a key determinant of bank leverage... Our results 
point to the financial channel of exchange rates, through which fluctuations 
in the strength of the dollar set in motion changes in capital market 
intermediation spreads that respond at a high frequency._ [Ili is when the 
domestic currency appreciates, financial conditions in that country loosen, 
and CIP deviations narrow... [A] strengthening of US dollar has adverse 
impacts on bank balance sheets, which, in turn, reduces banks ' risk bearing 
capacity.' The findings of this paper are consistent with two of the points 
made above, that we may re-enter a phase that is not that positive for EM 
currencies and that the dominance of the dollar as an international currency 
is having unintended consequences for the rest of the world, out of line with 
the local fundamentals. 
Trump and Europe. Political and social pressures have returned to Europe, 
and could continue to accentuate the centrifugal forces in the region. There 
are many risk events on the horizon, including the Austrian Presidential 
election on December 4 (the worry here is a victory for Mr Norbert Hofer of 
the far right party), the Italian referendum on Constitutional reform on 
December 4 (while a 'no' outcome is largely priced-in, an actual 'no' 
outcome may trigger a series of events in Italy that might pose some 
downside risks to Italian banks and in turn other European banks), the Dutch 
parliamentary election on March 15, 2017 (the worry here is further 
advances by the far right party led by Geert Wilders), the first round of the 
French presidential election on April 23 and the second round on May 7, UK 
local elections on May 4 (this will be the first major electoral test for PM 
May), and finally German regional elections on May 7 and 14 and the 
parliamentary election in September. (1) I don't think the direction of 
causality runs from Trump to Europe, but that the underlying forces 
propelling both Brexit and Trump are the same forces that are pushing the 
political centre of mass to the right in Europe. This direction of causality is 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026642 
i 
important to appreciate, I think, because if one believed that the direction of 
causality is the opposite, that Trump causes other changes that would have 
been avoidable if Ms Clinton had won, one would come up with the wrong 
conclusions on what to do to stop the global shift in sentiment. (2) The 
Economist had a special edition last week on the rising nationalism in the 
developed West, as if it's an unfounded, random and sinister event that 
needs to be suppressed by all means necessary. For various reasons, the 
political left is in decline in the developed West. Look at the UK's Labour 
Party and the US' Democratic Party. In France, only 1 out of 20 people 
approves of Hollande's performance. (3) The Presidential race in France is 
now between the Centre Right (Mr Fillon from the Republican Party) and 
the Far Right (Ms Le Pen from National Front). The pendulum in Europe, in 
my view, will swing to the right, and possibly overshoot, as pendulums tend 
to do... which is not good, but an unavoidable consequence of the pendulum 
having overshot to the left in the past... In any case, with the Republican 
primary being out of the way, the campaign will start in earnest, with the 
first round of the Presidential elections to take place in April and the second 
round in May. FWIW, Mr Fillon looks like a stronger candidate than Mr 
Sarkozy to challenge Ms Le Pen. France, under Mr Fillon, could very well 
enter a period of economic reform and rejuvenation, I am guessing. In short, 
Mr Fillon's victory last weekend could be a major positive for France, I 
think. 
The trouble with macroeconomics. The rebellion against the establishment 
has also begun in the nerdy field of macro economics, led in part by Prof 
Paul Romer of the Stern School of Business. He, of course, has made 
enemies in the field with his view — a view I share: 'For more than three 
decades, macroeconomics has gone backwards. The treatment of 
identification now is no more credible than in the early 1970s but escapes 
challenge because it is so much more opaque. Macroeconomic theorists 
dismiss mere facts by feigning an obtuse ignorance about such simple 
assertions as "tight monetwy policy can cause a recession." Their models 
attribute fluctuations in aggregate variables to imaginary causal forces that 
are not influenced by the action that any person takes. A parallel with string 
theory from physics hints at a general failure mode of science that is 
triggered when respect for highly regarded leaders evolves into a deference 
to authority that displaces objective fact from its position as the ultimate 
determinant of scientific truth.' Group think has become a serious 
impediment to advances and renewals in this important field. Misguided 
policies have also had significant consequences for people's lives around the 
world. 
Trade globalization. There will likely be a shift from unconditional, 
uncontrolled, and unmanaged trade globalisation, i.e. 'free trade', to 'fair 
trade,'. Trade globalisation of the type that we have just experienced 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026643 
exchanged rising economic and political inequality for overall 
prosperity. We have simply reached a point where this rising inequality is 
no longer sustainable in democracies. This is not too different from what 
Beijing has been struggling with — to slow down the headline economic 
growth rate in exchange for more balance in various parts of the economy, in 
order to allow its development to be more sustainable. The parallels in the 
West seem quite clear to me. Fighting against this shift in the West, as most 
mainstream media seem to be doing, is tantamount to those in China who are 
fighting against the economic slowdown. (1) TPP is effectively dead, even 
though there are some who are urging that TPP goes ahead without the 
US. But I think multilateral trade pacts are in jeopardy. The Trump 
Administration still wants to have trade arrangements, but they will be 
bilateral and done with countries deemed friendly to the US. (2) The UK is 
in a great position to deal with the Trump Administration because all the UK 
needs is a bilateral trade arrangement that won't take as long to work out, 
compared to a multilateral trade arrangement. The UK just went from the 
'back of the queue' (which was an insulting declaration by President Obama, 
conspicuously using the word 'queue' to make sure the Brits understood 
him) to the 'front of the line.' (3) China was never a part of the TPP 
discussions. In fact, TPP was designed from day one to marginalise China, 
to replace the current trade arrangement based on WTO rules to something 
that puts China at a disadvantage. This is why Beijing is not unhappy with 
the Trump Administration's desire to terminate the TPP discussions. (4) 
'America First' does not only mean 'world second,' that the US will take 
actions to benefit the US even if these policies come at the expense of the 
rest of the world. It also means that policies will be aimed at addressing the 
inequality and inequity in the US, even if it means that the overall effects on 
the US may be negative. (5) In sum, I don't think trade globalisation will 
reverse. But it will slow down dramatically and be substituted with a 
different web of bilateral arrangements. I think this is a positive 
development, as the previous model of global growth was unsustainable, 
even if it generated the biggest aggregate prosperity for the world. (6) The 
next US Treasury Secretary will likely be instructed by President Trump to 
label China as a currency manipulator. While this would be a verdict 
without basis, in my view, such a finding could be used as an excuse to 
escalate the talks of protectionism. 
Some musings... (1) President Obama just awarded his last round of 
Presidential Medals of Freedom (America's highest civilian honour) to 
Michael Jordan, Ellen DeGeneres, Robert de Niro, and others. Many of 
these award recipients were vocal critics of Mr Trump. My views on 
politics really don't matter... But for what it is worth, the reason why I have 
been more vocal than I should have been about Brexit and the US Elections 
is related to my own personal experience. I have witnessed how a previous 
harmonious society could very quickly degenerate into a permanent state of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026644 
ethnic hatred, through identity politics. This happened in Taiwan, where I 
grew up. When I was a child, I was fluent in Mandarin and Taiwanese, as 
most of the children I was friends with were not recent immigrants from 
Mainland China like my family was. There were no social conflicts, as far 
as I recall, until the pro-independence movement riled up those who 
considered themselves 'Taiwanese' against the 'Mainlanders' like 
myself Some of my Taiwanese childhood friends are no longer on speaking 
terms with me, simply because I'm a 'Mainlander.' Taiwan's economic 
development came to a sudden halt, as people were in a constant state of 
feeling mistreated by the other group. The pendulum would swing from one 
side (green) to the other (blue), each time a President is found to have 
committed blatant and large-scale corruption. The politicians won, but the 
people lost. This is one reason why I deeply resent identity politics and fear 
that the proponents don't truly understand how dangerous this game really 
can be. In contrast to the prevalent view, I believe indentity politics are 
themselves divisive. Economic cycles and political cycles come and go, but 
people can hate each other for generations. Look around the world; I think 
we can find plenty examples of irrational hatred between ethnic groups, 
ironically because one group felt they were wronged by another and the 
political discussions got hijacked by overly zealous politicians. (2) I love 
Michael Jordan and have nothing against Ellen DeGeneres, but think Robert 
de Niro made a fool of himself in that video. While this may not interest 
President Obama, Mr Joe Sutter just passed away: he was the 'Father of the 
Boeing 747', the lead engineer that designed and built the first B-747 in 
1969. Maybe one day someone will do a movie about him, and the actor 
playing him could win the Presidential Medal of Freedom... (3) An artist in 
China made a sculpture of a black swan (see the photo below), which was 
placed in a shopping mall in Beijing on the other side of the street from the 
headquarters of CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) — the 
government agency in charge of the securities markets and the agency that 
intervened to support the Chinese equity markets. This sculpture was 
quickly removed by government agents, within 3 hours of it being placed 
there. Months earlier, there were two sculptures of bears (mama bear and a 
baby bear) that were placed outside the same mall, and they were also 
removed quickly... Maybe I was wrong for belittling artists and 
entertainers: they may have the power to bring down the USD9 trillion 
equity markets in China with a small sculpture...

Subject: Markets and DJT
From: thomas jr. landon
To: jeevacation@gmail.com
Direction: thomas jr. landon → jeevacation@gmail.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am writing a story about how markets keep ripping ahead despite political craziness. VIX so low, etc. 
You must get a lot of this in talking to clients -- people freaking out about headlines as markets hit 
new highs. How do you spin this to them? One hedgie Trump supporter told me that Trump is the 
highest beta prez ever -- ie the highs will be high but so will be the lows. 
Question: how closely does DJT track market moves? I know he tweets about Dow 20,000 but how 
aware do you think he is about how market really betting big on him. Does he talk to Barrack about 
this? Cohn?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
China's big tech stocks have fallen into a bear 
market at the same time that regulatory threats 
against U.S. big tech companies are gaining 
momentum. Can U.S. big tech stocks soldier on 
alone or is this a harbinger that the group as a whole 
is losing its tremendous leadership position?

In recent months, China's BAT collapse has demonstrated how costly the expectation of 
invincibility can be—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are all down more than 24% 
from their year-to-date closing highs. Citigroup's head of Asia strategy, Mohammed 
Apabhai, told CNN an apt analogy about the investor sentiment that led to BAT's collapse, 
likening "the exuberance for tech stocks to the Looney Tunes cartoons in which Wile E. 
Coyote chases Road Runner over a cliff." Given they've more or less moved in 
tandem for years, will FAANG follow the same path as BAT?

The BAT collapse was triggered by subpar earnings and a shifting regulatory environment 
in China. Facebook's miss in 2Q18—which drove a $120 billion single-day market cap 
loss, the biggest ever for a U.S. company—showed how decisive a turn could be if more 
U.S. tech darlings stumble this quarter. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032806 
There are mounting fundamental reasons to question the 3Q18 earnings 
prospects of FAANG, from the accelerating user backlash against Facebook to Apple's 
trade war exposure to Amazon's rapidly-intensifying workforce revolt that could see the e-
commerce giant left with no option but to raise wages and improve workplace conditions 
for its warehouse and Whole Foods employees. 
However, as Apabhai suggests, the message BAT is sending is less about earnings, and 
more about the cost of exuberance. And FAANG exuberance faces threats that go beyond 
fundamentals. A flurry of regulatory announcements last week signaled the 
political tide has turned in the U.S. Across every branch of government, the 
message was consistent: the U.S. no longer trusts tech giants to self-
police. And the public agrees—according to a Gallup poll last month, 79% of 
Americans now believe "tech companies should be regulated the same way 
the news media is." 
Regardless of political will, threats may not turn to action in the near term. Nonetheless, 
FAANG appears increasingly vulnerable to a decisive sentiment shift. At some point, the 
relentless barrage of bad news will force investors to begin pricing in regulatory risks. Any 
sustained stumble by FAANG's leadership could cripple exuberance, and cause an 
unraveling of passive and algorithmic strategies that are heavily overweight tech 
(see W/LTWApril 7, 2018 for more). We will continue to watch closely to estimate 
timing, but given SAT's collapse, today more than ever, acute scrutiny of tech 
giant leadership is required. 
Through August 28, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft had accounted for greater than 35% of 
the S&P 500's total return this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. It took 
Amazon just 165 trading days to grow its market value from $600 billion in January to $1 
trillion. The combined market cap of FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and 
Google) now sits over $4 trillion, or roughly equal to the combined market cap of the 283 
smallest S&P 500 members. 
Tech's continued market leadership means investors have largely discounted 
the mounting risks tech giants face. We have been warning about the downsides of 
tech giant monopolism for more than two years in these pages, from surveillance/data 
security concerns to anticompetitive behavior and their role in escalating inequality. For 
the political establishment, for the media, for the public, this year has seen a 
broad awakening—the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the backlash against Jeff Bezos' 
astonishing wealth, and tech's ever-skyrocketing market caps were all warning signs. The 
past month signals a new phase has begun: from a distant rumbling of change 
to preparation for action. 
The number of significant tech-related regulatory developments that have emerged from 
the U.S. and the E.U. in recent weeks is nothing short of staggering. Here is an 
abbreviated list: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032807 
• President Trump attacked Google for liberal bias, and claimed Google, Facebook, 
and Amazon represent "a very antitrust situation". 
• Attorney General Jeff Sessions convened a meeting of Republican state 
attorneys general to discuss whether tech giants "may be hurting competition and 
intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms." 
• Facebook, Twitter, and Google were called to testify in front of the House and Senate 
about election interference, political bias, etc. Google declined to attend. 
• The FTC has begun a series of hearings on Digital Age antitrust, the first such 
hearings since the 1990s. 
• The FTC revealed the hiring of Lina Kahn—heralded for authoring a groundbreaking 
antitrust argument against Amazon—as an advisor. (See section 5 for more.) 
• Republican Senator Orrin Hatch asked the FTC to reopen a 2013 
antitrust case against Google. 
• Democratic Senator Mark Warner released a six-point policy proposal on regulating 
the tech industry. 
• Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the "BEZOS Act", which would tax 
corporations one dollar for every dollar low-wage workers receive in government health-
care benefits or food stamps. 
• The E.U. Parliament voted 438 to 226 to back a draft proposal of 
copyright reformsthat will impose unprecedented liability on information platforms. 
• France is pushing to have "Right to be Forgotten" laws applied globally, 
which Google is now fighting in court. 
• Reports emerged that the E.U. is considering investigating Google's location-
tracking practices on data privacy grounds. 
We will continue to watch each development in the U.S. and E.U. closely to understand if 
and when debate turns to action. For now, we agree with the analysis of NYU Stern 
professor Scott Galloway, who told CNBC last week after the congressional hearings: 
I don't see anything meaningful coming out of this panel, much less Washington...D.C. 
lacks the domain expertise or the will to go after big tech. Where you may 
see it is, one, out of Brussels and, two, out of [the FTC, the DOJ, or] a red 
state whose attorney general sees the brightest path between the AG's mansion and the 
governor's mansion is a populist argument against big tech. 
Evidence of fundamental weakness could exacerbate the investor reaction to escalating 
regulatory news. By all accounts, Facebook has continued to bleed 
users. According to Pew Research poll results released earlier this month, more than a 
quarter of U.S. Facebook users claim to have deleted the app from their phones over the 
past year:

Then there's Apple. The trade war combined with China's slowing economy present a 
significant short-term threat to the company's profits. As we note in section 
1, smartphone handset sales in China in August were reported at 32.6 million 
units, a decline of 20.9% year-over-year and 11.8% month-on-
month. Moreover, no firm could suffer more if China decides to target tech 
supply chains in retaliation to Trump's tariffs. 
Yet, the risks extend beyond Asia. On Wednesday, Apple announced its newest generation 
of iPhones. It is following the same strategy as last year, releasing ever-more expensive 
phones as it tries to keep profit growth on pace despite a largely-matured smartphone 
market. As The Wall Street Journal reported this week, projections suggest last year's 
$1,000 iPhone X underperformed previous launches: "Even for Apple and its devoted 
fans, the art of the upsell appears to have some limits...Analysts believe the 
iPhone X has accounted for about 30% of iPhone unit sales in the recent nine-month 
period...That is below the share the company's newest models typically get in a given 
cycle." Will a $1,200 iPhone cross the limits of what the market will tolerate? 
We have roughly a month until 3Q18 earnings season begins. For years, big tech's 
remarkable profit trajectory has generated an air of invincibility. BAT's earnings miss 
combined with Facebook's earnings miss has cracked that expectation. As news reports 
of regulatory threats continue to flood in and as tech giant profit doubts 
mount, the weeks to come could see that crack turn to a fissure.

In recent months, China's BAT collapse has demonstrated how costly the expectation of 
invincibility can be—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are all down more than 24% 
from their year-to-date closing highs. Citigroup's head of Asia strategy, Mohammed 
Apabhai, told CNN an apt analogy about the investor sentiment that led to BAT's collapse, 
likening "the exuberance for tech stocks to the Looney Tunes cartoons in which Wile E. 
Coyote chases Road Runner over a cliff." Given they've more or less moved in 
tandem for years, will FAANG follow the same path as BAT?
