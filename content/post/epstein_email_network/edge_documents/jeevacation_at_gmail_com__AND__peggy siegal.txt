HD: Wall Street, Take Two 
DEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back 
to business. Peggy Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her 
famous friends. Nice work if you can get it. 
In 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for "Platoon," he immediately turned to a 
domestic arena and began working on "Wall Street" in New York City where his father had been a 
stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has 
said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of finance (as seen through the Hal 
Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. 
At the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers 
from his earlier "Scarface" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both 
groups had an animalistic need to obtain big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and 
greed. 
Oliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud 
Fox, a kid from nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust 
into the fast lane with a rock star financial mentor who teaches him corruption. 
Oliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. 
Michael was not known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver 
also saw the anger, confidence, salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko 
looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's 
most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one could ever forget. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021235 
When Gekko delivers his speech, "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works," 
cinematic history was made. 
"Wall Street" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire 
financial services industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. 
Four years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film 
Entertainment co-chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board 
pending script approval. Steven Schiff wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered 
it obsolete. 
Alan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the 
social rhythms of New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko's character was modeled after '70s junk 
bond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new 
villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike Novogratz, geniuses who have created 
stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to direct, he rewrote a 
portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. 
This past September, Oliver yelled, "action" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he 
emerges from a lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to 
redefine himself in a different era. The New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers 
immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. 
A week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver 
designs an elaborate tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake 
Moore, a young idealistic investment banker played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, 
Moore's fiancée, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver 
played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gekko, who 
used to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. 
The shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In 
one take Michael makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on 
the set is courteous but quick and tense. There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. 
I watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers' canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff 
("Monsters Ball") and Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first "Wall Street." They have asked 
me to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. 
Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture gowns. "Give me the night before the 
Titanic goes down," were his exact words. Not a problem. 
I pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his 
personal publicist when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for "Wall Street" and we have 
remained great friends. Gekko is just as challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of 
technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' Broadway debut in a "Little Night Music." 
Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts received for 
their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021236 
I tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him 
and the production. 
8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 
65th Street and Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My 
hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white 
Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial titan husband David is unaware where she is this 
morning. 
Vanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage 
Geoffrey Beene, and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow 
fake flower on his lapel. Costume Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the 
first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. 
Oliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's "W"). His character Bretton (never Bret) 
James, a ruthless Wall Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano 
recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building 
actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the 
'60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and replaced with matching 
photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's 
vision. 
At 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, 
and her friend Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. 
Production assistants fuss over them. Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, 
and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to 
the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, Hamish and decorator Geoffrey 
Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. 
Oliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the 
scene, gives out lines to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that 
my earrings are too small. Wardrobe jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, "Action." The kid plays 
the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines 
and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours later a PA yells, "Lunch". 
In costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet "The Harpies," including Liz 
Smith, Barbara Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. 
Graydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in "Wall Street 2" as an extra. (I make 
this up.) Graydon jokes that he only works with lines. I say, "Not a problem." (This will be news to Oliver.) 
Back on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. 
Oliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard 
Don Marron saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie 
Mulligan hangs out watching boyfriend Shia work. 
At sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. 
(He loves it.) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021237 
Chuck Pfieffer plants a "Page Six" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. 
Thursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street 
Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate 
Chinese dinner. Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of 
calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and 
Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. 
Monday, November 9, 25 Broadway 
One hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of 
dawn for the Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. 
Susan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding 
area where we join Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, 
songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in 
see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld 
Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia Taylor and Italian 
newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. 
Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer 
gowns and work at break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. 
Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-
up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are alternately filled with steaming coffee, 
fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of excitement. 
We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie 
Sheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He 
is now the highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of "Two and a Half Men." 
Oliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to 
the camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight 
lines challenging their concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, "Action" as the extras aggressively 
jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband 
Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and my marriage has become a threesome. 
Sensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a 
dinner table with Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-
Platero. He directs us to chat with each other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. 
Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old 
Eli Wallach and Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who 
throws himself in front of a train early in the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia 
Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international 
banker. 
Lunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021238 
Susan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, 
schools, country houses and vacations. 
Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live 
music. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, 
watches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old 
father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his 
hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes. 
The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is 
close to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner 
for artists uptown. 
Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of 
the shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, "We must do lunch". Ever the proper English gentleman, 
William advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot 
continues for numerous takes following Josh and NoeIle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom 
with one-line greetings. 
At last, "It's a wrap" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, "a day of 
electrifying glamour," and "the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours." 
November 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting 
Donald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet 
from Teterboro with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in 
September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at "21" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they 
could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment. 
The scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial 
comeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. 
The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite 
suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about 
the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a "comb over" like his famous 
do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, "No thanks Donald, I am a gel man." 
The crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across 
the street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. 
Michael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan 
splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver 
Stone's surprise endings. 
Twentieth Century Fox releases "Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps" on April 23rd and it's got hit written 
all over it.

Chuck Pfieffer plants a "Page Six" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. 
Thursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street 
Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate 
Chinese dinner. Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of 
calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and 
Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. 
Monday, November 9, 25 Broadway 
One hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of 
dawn for the Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. 
Susan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding 
area where we join Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, 
songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in 
see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld 
Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia Taylor and Italian 
newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. 
Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer 
gowns and work at break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. 
Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-
up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are alternately filled with steaming coffee, 
fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of excitement. 
We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie 
Sheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He 
is now the highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of "Two and a Half Men." 
Oliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to 
the camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight 
lines challenging their concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, "Action" as the extras aggressively 
jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband 
Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and my marriage has become a threesome. 
Sensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a 
dinner table with Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-
Platero. He directs us to chat with each other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. 
Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old 
Eli Wallach and Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who 
throws himself in front of a train early in the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia 
Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international 
banker. 
Lunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032008 
Susan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, 
schools, country houses and vacations. 
Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live 
music. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, 
watches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old 
father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his 
hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes. 
The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is 
close to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner 
for artists uptown. 
Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of 
the shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, "We must do lunch". Ever the proper English gentleman, 
William advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot 
continues for numerous takes following Josh and NoeIle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom 
with one-line greetings. 
At last, "It's a wrap" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, "a day of 
electrifying glamour," and "the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours." 
November 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting 
Donald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet 
from Teterboro with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in 
September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at "21" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they 
could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment. 
The scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial 
comeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. 
The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite 
suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about 
the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a "comb over" like his famous 
do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, "No thanks Donald, I am a gel man." 
The crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across 
the street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. 
Michael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan 
splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver 
Stone's surprise endings. 
Twentieth Century Fox releases "Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps" on April 23rd and it's got hit written 
all over it.

HD: Wall Street, Take Two 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021241 
DEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back to business. Peggy 
Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her famous friends. Nice work if you can get 
it. 
In 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for "Platoon," he immediately turned to a domestic arena 
and began working on "Wall Street" in New York City where his father had been a stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen 
as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of 
finance (as seen through the Hal Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. 
At the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers from his earlier 
"Scarface" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both groups had an animalistic need to obtain 
big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and greed. 
Oliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud Fox, a kid from 
nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust into the fast lane with a rock star 
financial mentor who teaches him corruption. 
Oliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. Michael was not 
known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver also saw the anger, confidence, 
salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked 
back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one 
could ever forget. 
When Gekko delivers his speech, "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works," cinematic history was 
made. 
"Wall Street" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire financial services 
industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. 
Four years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film Entertainment co-
chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board pending script approval. Steven Schiff 
wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered it obsolete. 
Alan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the social rhythms of 
New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko 's character was modeled after '70s junk bond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s 
mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike 
Novogratz, geniuses who have created stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko 's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to 
direct, he rewrote a portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. 
This past September, Oliver yelled, "action" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he emerges from a 
lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to redefine himself in a different era. The 
New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. 
A week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver designs an elaborate 
tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake Moore, a young idealistic investment banker 
played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, Moore's fiancee, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an 
off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021242 
of Art. Gekko, who used to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. 
The shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In one take Michael 
makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on the set is courteous but quick and tense. 
There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. 
I watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff ("Monsters Ball") and 
Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first "Wall Street." They have asked me to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene 
and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture 
gowns. "Give me the night before the Titanic goes down," were his exact words. Not a problem. 
I pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his personal publicist 
when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for "Wall Street" and we have remained great friends. Gekko is just as 
challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' 
Broadway debut in a "Little Night Music." Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts 
received for their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. 
I tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him and the 
production. 
8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 65th Street and 
Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia 
Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial 
titan husband David is unaware where she is this morning. 
Vanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage Geoffrey Beene, 
and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow fake flower on his lapel. Costume 
Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. 
Oliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's "W"). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, a ruthless Wall 
Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their 
huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still 
famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the '60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and 
replaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's 
vision. 
At 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, and her friend 
Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production assistants fuss over them. 
Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate 
wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, 
Hamish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. 
Oliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene, gives out lines 
to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings are too small. Wardrobe 
jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, "Action." The kid plays the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for 
money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours 
later a PA yells, "Lunch". 
In costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet "The Harpies," including Liz Smith, Barbara 
Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. 
Graydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in "Wall Street 2" as an extra. (I make this up.) Graydon 
jokes that he only works with lines. I say, "Not a problem." (This will be news to Oliver.) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021243 
Back on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. 
Oliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard Don Marron 
saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan hangs out watching 
boyfriend Shia work. 
At sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He loves it.) 
Chuck Pfieffer plants a "Page Six" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. 
Thursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street 
Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese dinner. 
Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing 
himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. 
Monday, November 9, 25 Broadway 
One hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the 
Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. 
Susan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join 
Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly 
Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer 
Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia 
Taylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. 
Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at 
break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa 
with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are 
alternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of 
excitement. 
We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins. 
Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a days work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor 
commanding two million dollars an episode of "Two and a Half Men." 
Oliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the 
camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their 
concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, "Action" as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an 
easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and 
my marriage has become a threesome. 
Sensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with 
Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each 
other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. 
Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and 
Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in 
the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021244 
agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. 
Lunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including Susan, Jill and me 
to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, country houses and vacations. 
Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. Prince 
Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches from a table with scattered 
champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and 
Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between 
takes. 
The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 p.m. and 
Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists uptown. 
Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the shot and 
instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, "We must do lunch". Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises Oliver that Lords do not 
use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as 
every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings. 
At last, "It's a wrap" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, "a day of electrifying 
glamour," and "the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours." 
November 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting 
Donald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from Teterboro 
with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to 
dinner at "21" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural 
environment. 
The scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial comeback. The scene opens

HD: Wall Street, Take Two 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031999 
DEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back to business. Peggy 
Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her famous friends. Nice work if you can get 
it. 
In 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for "Platoon," he immediately turned to a domestic arena 
and began working on "Wall Street" in New York City where his father had been a stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen 
as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of 
finance (as seen through the Hal Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. 
At the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers from his earlier 
"Scarface" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both groups had an animalistic need to obtain 
big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and greed. 
Oliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud Fox, a kid from 
nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust into the fast lane with a rock star 
financial mentor who teaches him corruption. 
Oliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. Michael was not 
known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver also saw the anger, confidence, 
salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked 
back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one 
could ever forget. 
When Gekko delivers his speech, "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works," cinematic history was 
made. 
"Wall Street" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire financial services 
industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. 
Four years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film Entertainment co-
chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board pending script approval. Steven Schiff 
wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered it obsolete. 
Alan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the social rhythms of 
New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko 's character was modeled after '70s junk bond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s 
mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike 
Novogratz, geniuses who have created stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko 's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to 
direct, he rewrote a portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. 
This past September, Oliver yelled, "action" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he emerges from a 
lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to redefine himself in a different era. The 
New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. 
A week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver designs an elaborate 
tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake Moore, a young idealistic investment banker 
played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, Moore's fiancee, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an 
off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032000 
of Art. Gekko, who used to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. 
The shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In one take Michael 
makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on the set is courteous but quick and tense. 
There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. 
I watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff ("Monsters Ball") and 
Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first "Wall Street." They have asked me to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene 
and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture 
gowns. "Give me the night before the Titanic goes down," were his exact words. Not a problem. 
I pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his personal publicist 
when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for "Wall Street" and we have remained great friends. Gekko is just as 
challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' 
Broadway debut in a "Little Night Music." Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts 
received for their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. 
I tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him and the 
production. 
8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 65th Street and 
Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia 
Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial 
titan husband David is unaware where she is this morning. 
Vanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage Geoffrey Beene, 
and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow fake flower on his lapel. Costume 
Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. 
Oliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's "W"). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, a ruthless Wall 
Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their 
huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still 
famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the '60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and 
replaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's 
vision. 
At 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, and her friend 
Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production assistants fuss over them. 
Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate 
wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, 
Hamish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. 
Oliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene, gives out lines 
to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings are too small. Wardrobe 
jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, "Action." The kid plays the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for 
money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours 
later a PA yells, "Lunch". 
In costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet "The Harpies," including Liz Smith, Barbara 
Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. 
Graydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in "Wall Street 2" as an extra. (I make this up.) Graydon 
jokes that he only works with lines. I say, "Not a problem." (This will be news to Oliver.) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032001 
Back on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. 
Oliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard Don Marron 
saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan hangs out watching 
boyfriend Shia work. 
At sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He loves it.) 
Chuck Pfieffer plants a "Page Six" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. 
Thursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street 
Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese dinner. 
Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing 
himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. 
Monday, November 9, 25 Broadway 
One hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the 
Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. 
Susan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join 
Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly 
Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer 
Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia 
Taylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. 
Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at 
break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa 
with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are 
alternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of 
excitement. 
We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins. 
Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a days work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor 
commanding two million dollars an episode of "Two and a Half Men." 
Oliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the 
camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their 
concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, "Action" as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an 
easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and 
my marriage has become a threesome. 
Sensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with 
Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each 
other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. 
Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and 
Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in 
the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032002 
agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. 
Lunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including Susan, Jill and me 
to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, country houses and vacations. 
Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. Prince 
Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches from a table with scattered 
champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and 
Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between 
takes. 
The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 p.m. and 
Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists uptown. 
Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the shot and 
instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, "We must do lunch". Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises Oliver that Lords do not 
use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as 
every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings. 
At last, "It's a wrap" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, "a day of electrifying 
glamour," and "the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours." 
November 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting 
Donald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from Teterboro 
with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to 
dinner at "21" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural 
environment. 
The scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial comeback. The scene opens 
on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is 
finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the 
shop for a cut and the banter begins about the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a "comb over" 
like his famous do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, "No thanks Donald, I am a gel man." 
The crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across the street. The 
unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. Michael comes out, and the press 
think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run 
the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver Stone's surprise endings. 
Twentieth Century Fox releases "Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps" on April 23rd and its got hit written all over it.

We are keen to explore the possibility of conducting an interview with Mr Epstein, on the subject of the stories which are circulating, 
however inaccurately, about both him and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; we'd be keen to hear from Mr Epstein first hand so that 
the various and at times, speculative reporting which is at large in the UK press can be better scrutinised? 
Let me tell you a bit about the Today programme. 
Today is the BBC's main morning news show; we have been part of the BBC for over 50 years and are generally considered one of the 
most important news broadcast outlets - either on radio or TV - here in the UK. We set the news agenda for the BBC and in many 
respects we set the daily news agenda for the country. Our interviews are regularly re broadcast across the BBC's national and 
international news network including - BBC World, BBC World Service and BBC Online. The combination of these outlets means 
the global 'reach of a BBC Today programme interview is second to none. 
Programme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international relations and the arts 
including US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, President Nicholas Sarkozy, President Hamid Karzai, HRH the Prince of Wales, 
former President Musharraf, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former President Bill Clinton, Senator George Mitchell, Al 
Gore, Kofi Annan, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Dalai Lama, Bill Gates, George Soros, Stephen Hawking, Sir Paul 
McCartney, Mick Jaggar and Salman Rushdie. 
We are a programme that carries considerable weight and influence and which prides itself in being a first port of call for many of the 
most important and influential figures on the international stage. 
I can best be reached via my cell phone - or this email address.

Peg --
Obviously, I'm sharing what follows on the assumption that everything here is just between us. 
The thesis of the Times piece is that the rich and their corporations have SO much power 
that we no longer live in a democracy. 
Can "we the people" make change? Not really. 
Who can? The rich and powerful. 
Huh? All they want is the status quo. Or more. 
But they could --- okay, its not likely, but they could --- turn on the bad actors at their social/economic level. 
For example: Wall Street CEOs, donors to the Tea Party, etc. 
That's the topic. Shaming. Shunning. 
One of the people I deal with --- there are several others. --- is Jeffrey Epstein. 
Reading the clips, I don't see that Jeffrey as been shunned. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031691 
In this piece --- http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-epsteins-
society-friends-close-ranks/ ---
I read: 
The crowd at the events top publicist Peggy Siegal has organized for Epstein proves the point, at least behind closed doors. "I and 
many others that know him describe him as brilliant," says Siegal. 
"His unique mind is what attracts the world's smartest people to his home." Last September, with Siegal's help, Epstein hosted a Break 
Fast after Yom Kippur. A group of 120 friends brought their children over for a buffet dinner 
This was just a few months after he finished his prison obligations in Florida. 
And here he is, entertaining --- with children present. 
This Break Fast is one of a number of social events involving post-prison Jeffrey that attracted celebrated, powerful people. 
Of course I have zero idea who said, "NO WAY" and didn't cross his doorway. 
My questions are: 
1) I You have known him for decades, were/are friends, etc. 
Why was your reaction to his crimes to continue being his friend --- and not in a covert way? 
2) What would he have had to do for you to shun him --- to cut him out of your life? 
You're the ultimate professional; you may not want to respond. 
Especially because I'm NOT reaching out to anyone else who's named in the piece. 
I don't care about them. 
But it ain't me to blindside you.

If you rewrite your last email in better grammar, (and so I have a better understanding) I can cut and paste and send it to Arianna 
Huffington from me 
Did you know why Prince Alberts Charlene fled to the airport with a one way ticket back to South Africa? Because she found out 
about a third illegitimate child that is 3 months old...the palace officials followed her to the airport and propably made her an offer she 
could not refuse.. will get details from Jim Coleman when he comes home Sunday night. 
In Southampton now. Peg

should you point out to Ariana Huff, that the same type of person, same as strauss Kahn i s Andrews accuser, long criminal record. 
total liar. Ariana should champion the dangers of false allegations. send a reporter or reporters to investigate,., the palace would love 
it, the girl in the photo , was nothing more than a telephone answerer„ she was never 15, according to her version she worked for 
trump , first at that age, at MAra lago. ITs ridiculous, but the press like strauss kahn is afraid to question women.

Subject: Oscar Diary 
It's Thursday morning on Wilshire Boulevard and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has just 
opened it's doors for ticket pick-up for the 85th Oscar telecast. 
Forty voting members, the distinguished director Norman Jewison and I are on a long single file line that 
snakes thru the lobby patiently waiting to go upstairs to pick up our tickets. My seats were awarded via 
a lottery system. We clutch our photo I.D. 
Suddenly, a messenger slips in wearing a smart khaki windbreaker and cuts through the line. He announces 
to the uniformed guard in a stage whisper, "Dreamworks", and as if Steven Spielberg himself had just 
delivered the Gettysburg address, is ushered upstairs. 
That is the final act of social justice of the "Lincoln" campaign. 
I am sleep deprived and jet lagged having just spent six hours on a flight sitting next Paula Wagner who 
is Tom Cruise's ex-agent turned Broadway producer for Jessica Chastain's "The Heiress". We discuss 
Jessica's not so great chances to beat Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress. I mention Harvey Weinstein's 
concern about Emmanuel Riva's last minute surge. The French phenomena doesn't speak English, has never 
been to L.A. and it's like voting for a ghost, even on her 86th birthday. 
This is the year I got phone calls in September from top studio executives announcing each are winning 
the Oscar. Their euphoric giddiness is due to the quality of the films resulting in the priciest oscar 
campaigns on record and astounding audience support at the theaters. 
Seven of the nine best picture nominees have taken in well over $100 million at the domestic box office 
to date, but it's the worldwide numbers in the millions that are staggering. 
Twentieth Century Fox's "Life of Pi" caused a tsunami at $595, 
Universal's "Les Miserables" scored $412, the Weinstein Cos.' "Django Unchained" whipped up $395, 
DreamWorks' "Lincoln" delivered at $254, Warner's "Argo" captured $219, Weinstein's "Silver Lining 
Playbook" danced to $187 and Sony's "Zero Dark Thirty" killed at $107 million. 
In comparison, Sony Classics' "Amour" received $19 and Fox Searchlights' "Beast of the Southern Wild" 
worked up $19 million. 
Hugh audiences having actually seen the films this year have an ear for the nuances of the Oscar race and 
everyone including Ben Affleck follow the bloggers religiously. 
So by Thursday morning on line at the Academy the informed buzz was as follows: "Argo" takes best 
picture because is was most entertaining. The director snub to Ben Affleck was a Godsend as George 
Clooney's advice came from far away Berlin where he was in pre-production on "The Monuments Men". 
Warner's president Sue Kroll kept the campaign clean and calm on the home front. 
"Lincoln's" victory is Daniel Day Lewis from day one of shooting, no pun intended. The suggestion that 
Obama is our answer to Lincoln was interesting. Voters knew Obama secretly hosted three screenings in the 
White House, but they weren't invited. The Hollywood Foreign press were the biggest winners with Bill 
Clinton's surprise appearance on their broadcast. DreamWorks' ran an impeccable patriotic campaign that 
the media ate up. 
The best director race had the most drama. Hollywood dreaded Spielberg loosing to Ang Lee. (Eventually 
everyone was thrilled Steven was anointed president of the Cannes Jury for 2013 the day after the awards 
show.) 
The voters knew beloved Ang Lee's three year boat ride was the technical miracle. Fox's $595 million 
international box office blew in the win. 
Harvey Weinstein having three horses running is always the most talked about. His loquacious Quentin 
Tarentino was a lock for screenplay. Best supporting actor was a total toss up with a sentimental edge 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019465 
to Robert DeNiro. We even applauded Bob putting his handprints in cement in front of Grauman's Chinese 
Theater. 
The conversations continued about how our government put the cabasch on "Zero Dark Thirty" with their 
arrogant denial of enhanced interrogation. Even MPAA President Chris Dodd could not help Mark Boal, 
Katherine Bigalow and Amy Pascal. 
Additional chatter was the renewed last minute love for "Les Miserables". Clearly the most polarizing 
film in the race, this 27 year old theatrical musical seen by 60 million fans is now the talk of the 
Oscar weekend. 
Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Amanda Segfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sasha Baron Cohen, Helena 
Bonham Carter and Samanthe Barks are making an historic one time live performance as part of Sunday's 
television broadcast. Producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron's will attempt to razzel dazzel us with an 
homage to movie musicals for three plus hours at the Dolby theater. 
Barbra Streisand, Adele and Shirley Basse's appearances also create high anxiety and a blood bath for 
tickets...hence the hysteria created by DreamWorks' messenger cutting the line. 
After checking into the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel, my home away from home for 30 years of Oscar weekends 
and meticulously laying out all the ensembles sent from Valentino and Ralph Rucci, I hit the party 
circuit overdressed for life. 
Daisy... I can do this...fairly easily now...but I have a lunch at 12:30pm and important meetings. I am 
so distraught about all this pressure. I am calling you now. Peggy

Hello Jeffrey — 
, Richard Kahn 
I hope all is well with you. As per Peggy Siegal's office, I have included here the invitation to the IFP Gotham Awards 
ceremony, which will be held on Monday, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. 
This year's ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn't be more thrilled with this year's impressive 
group of Tributees. The Actress Tribute will go to Nicole Kidman and the Actor Tribute to Dustin Hoffman. The 
Director Tribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the 
Industry Tribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn't be more 
pleased to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year's special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028498 
ranging from Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Blige, this 
year's ceremony looks to be the most star studded ever. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Best regards, 
Steven
