Dear Professor Krauss, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031027 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics' Guide to the 
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the 
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein: 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-
epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/  
Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
"If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge," says Krauss. "Jeffrey has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I 
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would 
believe him over other people." Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, 
Krauss insists, "I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it."

Dear Professor Krauss, 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics' Guide to the 
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the 
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein: 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-
epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/  
Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
"If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge," says Krauss. "Jeffrey has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I 
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would 
believe him over other people." Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, 
Krauss insists, "I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it."

Here is my response to the hundreds who are now attacking me on the web: 
I will add one remark here, as most people have not read my full set of comments, posted after the post 
appeared.. I am myself rather disappointed by the lack of skepticality of this community. As I said, I have read 
numerous reports of orgies on Jeffrey's island involving me and other scientists during our meetings.. Orgies 
that never happened, I am VERY skeptical of other claims on his behavior. I am defending Jeffrey for 2 
reasons: (1) Based on my knowledge and experience I am skeptical of the claims in the media and of those who 
have settled claims for money... namely I don't believe the published details just like I tend to be skeptical of 
many published details on the internet.. I don't believe Jeffrey did what has been claimed, and unless I see hard 
evidence, I will trust my own judgement here, and (2) Jeffrey went to prison, and I happen to believe that 
having served time, even those who questioned his behavior should be willing to give him the benefit of the 
doubt, again until proved otherwise, that he is working hard to live a good life and do good things. I for one am 
disgusted that people eat up the salacious nonsense the read on the web and then jump to conclusions about 
things and people they do not know.. I do not jump to condemn people, especially when it concerns their sexual 
preferences. I DO NOT CONDONE sex with young girls, or young boys for that matter.. because there are real 
victims there.. Until I know all the facts however, I do not jump to conclusions, and I am sorry, having seen the 
media frenzy around Jeffrey, and having seen the shoddy behavior of those who have attacked him, I remain 
skeptical, and I support a man whose character I believe I know.. If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.

Dear Professor Krauss, 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics' Guide to the 
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the 
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein: 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-
epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/  
Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
"If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge," says Krauss. "Jeffrey has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I 
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would 
believe him over other people." Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, 
Krauss insists, "I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it."

I know.. it is one of the reasons I respect you. 
btw.. this was the last note I sent out to the blogs... after that I gave up.. 
"I will add one remark here, as most people have not read my full set of comments, posted after the post 
appeared.. I am myself rather disappointed by the lack of skepticality of this community. As I said, I have read 
numerous reports of orgies on Jeffrey's island involving me and other scientists during our meetings.. Orgies 
that never happened. I am VERY skeptical of other claims on his behavior. I am defending Jeffrey for 2 
reasons: (1) Based on my knowledge and experience I am skeptical of the claims in the media and of those who 
have settled claims for money... namely I don't believe the published details just like I tend to be skeptical of 
many published details on the internet.. I don't believe Jeffrey did what has been claimed, and unless I see hard 
evidence, I will trust my own judgement here, and (2) Jeffrey went to prison, and I happen to believe that 
having served time, even those who questioned his behavior should be willing to give him the benefit of the 
doubt, again until proved otherwise, that he is working hard to live a good life and do good things. I for one am 
disgusted that people eat up the salacious nonsense they read on the web and then jump to conclusions about 
things and people they do not know.. I do not jump to condemn people, especially when it concerns their sexual 
preferences. I DO NOT CONDONE sex with young girls, or young boys for that matter.. because there are real 
victims there.. Until I know all the facts however, I do not jump to conclusions, and I am sorry, having seen the 
media frenzy around Jeffrey, and having seen the shoddy behavior of those who have attacked him, I remain 
skeptical, and I support a man whose character I believe I know.. If you want to condemn me for that, so be it."

But I don't see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while

should ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with argument 
and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of secular dogma) 
are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard sometimes. For example, when 
the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs informs us that the US, unlike 
other countries, has a "transcendental purpose," and the fact that it constantly acts in contradiction to its purpose 
doesn't matter because the facts are just "abuse of history" while real history is "the evidence of history as our minds

and the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads to major human disasters. 
On Davis, I frankly think that's a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment

On confronting dogma, I of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. — 
are much more dangerous. And if some find rational discussion offensive — as, for example, mainstream academics 
find dismantling myths of "American exceptionalism" or "Israeli self-defense" or Obama's mass murder campaign, 
etc., offensive — so be it. 
But I don't see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while 
recognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while their 
beliefs are confronted with evidence. I also don't see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as I don't think we 
should ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with 
argument and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of 
secular dogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard 
sometimes. For example, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs 
informs us that the US, unlike other countries, has a "transcendental purpose," and the fact that it constantly acts in 
contradiction to its purpose doesn't matter because the facts are just "abuse of history" while real history is "the 
evidence of history as our minds reflect it," then it's hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There's no point ridiculing

I was in antarctica. The west antarctic ice sheet is melting at an unprecedented rate.. if it all goes into the ocean, 
sea levels will rise by about a meter. You are correct that we should ask if it can be reduced.. We are currently 
involved in a proposal that explores capturing CO2 from the atmosphere.. That may cost about 100/ton CO2.. if 
there was a carbon tax, that might be doable. it is not clear yet, but total research on this so far <10 
Million. Total research each year on oil and gas exploration >2 billion.

is more bad news as far as I am concerned because this big budget will decimate real science.. 900 million cut

normaly thier strategy will be to take back your defense to the accusers. and attack each one. if they find you

to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of 
your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, 
then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it 
also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to 
respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also 
an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they 
trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as 
they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time 
with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is 
false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather 
than allegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me 
or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers falsely and inaccurately to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 
where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were respectful 
and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim 
because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university 
action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was 
harassing them? The second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to 
the fact that the claim is false, which is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me 
with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her 
year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so I told her 
that she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these 
occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested in knowing what we could 
do, if necessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I 
wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have 
numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and on several 
occasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off 
campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with 
students on campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat even students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked 
when I later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no 
inappropriate interaction and also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently offended, she continued to 
email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for 
which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to 
drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would 
pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was shocked and 
concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, I was 
told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed at that time to be called for, and that the young woman in question 
had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at 
ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with 
my colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona at the time I was asked 
not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was 
basically moot because I was not on campus. I was also told that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain 
confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the 
complaint from my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never 
any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and morever the outside complaints were in fact related 
specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual 
who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged 
transgression. I was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both 
Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the 
University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion 
that it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. . In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month found 
significant inconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial 
complaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made 
in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated 
"It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident." 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again moot because I was a 
hemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim 
and apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which I quote: 
"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021417 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in 
an unwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee who took the selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took 
the selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested 
in the course of the investigation." 
(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies not to include flashes, 
so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour) 
What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come 
up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. I am particularly proud of the way I attempt to make all 
people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which is to 
acknowledge fans in a way that makes them feel appreciated. As I understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take 
selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, I am proud of the 
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and ethnicities. I have worked hard 
to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.

From: Peter Aldhous ________________ 
Subject: URGENT: BuzzFeed News inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment 
Date: December 10, 2017 at 5:12:27 PM PST  
To: 
Dr. Krauss: 
As you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations 
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations 
in detail. 
In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 
below). You claimed that "both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and 
fabricated with malicious intent." We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious 
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. 
The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve 
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. 
I am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia 
Hughes. 
Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). 
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, 
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the 
Center for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled 
complaints and concerns about your behavior during this time. 
Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and 
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, 
students, and peers in the skeptics movement. 
I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you 
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are 
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. 
Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: 
Incident 1: 
• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a 
volunteer for CFI D.C. 
• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked 
her if she was "of age." 
• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. 
• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. 
• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. 
• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, 
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. 
• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. 
• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and 
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights. 
• She struggled to push you off her. 
• You said, "When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021420 
• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said "I have to go," and rushed out of 
the room. 
Incident 2: 
• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve 
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it 
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. 
• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student 
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored 
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. 
• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without 
mentioning you by name. "There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought 
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me 
upset for weeks afterward," she wrote. 
• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, 
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and 
she did. 
• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. 
• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student 
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: 
"This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment 
policy. 
• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she 
remained at Case. 
11 
• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics 
department before setting foot on the campus again. 
• The letter also stated, "Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also 
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with 
students." 
• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the 
month before. 
• "The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career," 
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. 
Incident 3: 
• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous 
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. 
Incident 4: 
• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists 
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she 
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. 
• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student 
and volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. 
• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. 
• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a 
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. 
• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021421 
• You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the 
table. 
• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She 
crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. 
Incident 5: 
• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were 
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your 
female companion for sex in your cabin. 
• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged 
CFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, 
however. 
Incident 6: 
• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once 
again. 
• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker. 
• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. 
• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her 
right breast. 
• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. "Don't do that," she said. 
• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College 
of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your 
hand in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses 
have confirmed the complainant's account of what happened. 
• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your 
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 
incident. 
• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National 
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting 
appointments. 
• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But 
neither university found against you. 
• "Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate 
the allegations," Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. 
• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an 
inquiry "did not find a violation of university policy." 
• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints 
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general 
counsel, noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. "The 
University did not find either communication to state a credible allegation," Jewett wrote. 
Miscellaneous facts: 
• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort 
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. 
• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent 
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021422 
with biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public 
intellectuals. 
• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a 
vocal critic of President Donald Trump. 
• You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and 
atheists. 
• At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon 
with you and Dawkins. 
• Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told — 
So Far. 
• Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned "Lawrence Krauss for President." 
• In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that 
religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe. 
• You have stated that science provides answers to many of life's biggest questions, and can even fix 
great societal injustices. 
• Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the 
dearth of women and minorities in science. "Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias," you 
said. "It's built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical 
evidence." 
• You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in 
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail. 
• Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has 
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently 
pledging $100,000 in 2014. 
• In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: "As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and 
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my 
presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people." 
• In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: "I remain skeptical, and I support a man 
whose character I believe I know.. .If you want to condemn me for that, so be it." 
• You were made an honorary member of CFI's board of directors in December 2011. 
• A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post, 
published at around the same time, described incident #5. 
• The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault 
were "potentially illegal." The second post was quickly taken down. 
Again, if you wish to comment on or clarify any of these points, please get in touch with us as soon as 
possible. If I do not respond immediately it is because I am on another call, so please leave the best phone 
number to reach you. 
Thanks,

Apologies for the multiple emails. 
Regarding #1, you say it "refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we mutually 
decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were 
respectful and platonic encounters afterwards." 
To clarify, are you saying that this mutual decision was reached in the hotel room? Or was this discussed 
subsequently?

Dear Dr. Krauss, 
Thank you for your responses, which state that the allegations made against you are false and/or distorted. 
That does raise a question: 
Why do you think that multiple women, over more than a decade, have separately made accusations against 
you? 
Sincerely,

I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and 
then heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will 
report my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be 
complete, as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading 
my responses, I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to 
distort them. 
It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading 
statements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, 
colleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which I am a part. I 
do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other 
institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the 
opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031434 
me up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of 
which the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with 
which I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like 
CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in 
my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings 
to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my 
talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to 
impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 
'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in 
context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me 
to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 
where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, 
and there were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which 
involves an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it 
clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying 
that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The 
second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who accompanied 
me on the cruise, and has attested to the fact that the claim is false. This is what I wrote at the time in response 
to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came 
to me, asked me to talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after 
graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested 
in going on to graduate school in physics, but she was interested in science communication so I told her that 
she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on 
one of these occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member and 
department chair I was interested in knowing what we could do, if necessary to encourage more women to go 
into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made 
a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous 
requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and 
on several occasions she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let 
her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it, 
and I believe she found it useful. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and I see 
nothing wrong with this. I try to treat students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked when I later 
learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no 
inappropriate interaction but also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently 
offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS 
conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of 
recommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her 
off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, again in 2008, I expressed 
that I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the 
complaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my 
concerns and explaining the situation, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was 
requested. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to 
accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the 
University, the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there— both among the faculty (many of whom in 
physics I had hired while department chair)) and among the administration, along with a very attractive 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031435 
counter-offer by Case. Because I was already in Arizona at the later time I was asked not to have any further 
interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was 
basically moot because I was not on campus. Following this episode, as indicated in the letter to the student, I 
did assess what might have led to misinterpretations by this student, and became more careful in offering 
advice when talking to students. I was also told by human resources that because it was decided to handle this 
informally and not formally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no 
further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would preserve its confidentiality and remove 
the complaint from my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised and concerned that someone violated 
that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University 
specifically stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the 
University, and moreover that the 'outside complaints' were in fact related specifically to your item 
#6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual 
who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the 
alleged transgression. I was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the 
basis of this but was told by both Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third 
party complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was 
investigated by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university 
policies had been violated. In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month, found various 
inconsistencies in the allegation, which suggest distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU 
report. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU until it 
was dismissed, outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated 
"It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the 
time of the incident." 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again 
moot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report, from which I quote below absolved me of any 
wrongdoing, reinstating my position, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim and 
apparent later claims: 
"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly 
touched in 
an unwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee who took the `selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
-The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who 
took 
the `selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was 
requested 
in the course of the investigation." 
(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request 
selfies not to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next 
half hour. Moreover, I have no idea if the other eyewitnesses you quote, who were not involved in any 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031436 
complaint, were in fact there but this was a formal banquet with individuals and their partners, which I 
attended long enough to agree to sign things and do selfies before leaving early because I was tired. Even if I 
had any such intent it would have been lunacy to pose for selfies in front of a group and openly do such a 
thing, including presumably in front of this person's partner, . Which, besides the fact that I don't do such 
things, is one of the many reasons it never happened.) 
What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, 
and when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, or sometimes aggressive. I am particularly 
proud of the way I work to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated, whatever their 
behavior or request. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which characterizes all my 
interactions with fans: to acknowledge them in a way that makes them feel appreciated and respected. As I 
understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this 
year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed and should report on. Moreover, I am proud of the 
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and 
ethnicities. I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as 
responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.

As you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations 
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations 
in detail. 
In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 
below). You claimed that "both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and 
fabricated with malicious intent." We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious 
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. 
The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve 
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. 
I am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia 
Hughes. 
Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). 
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, 
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the 
Center for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled 
complaints and concerns about your behavior during this time. 
Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and 
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, 
students, and peers in the skeptics movement. 
I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you 
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are 
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. 
Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: 
Incident 1: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031437 
• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a 
volunteer for CFI D.C. 
• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked 
her if she was "of age." 
• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. 
• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. 
• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. 
• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, 
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. 
• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. 
• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and 
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights. 
• She struggled to push you off her. 
• You said, "When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you." 
• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said "I have to go," and rushed out of 
the room. 
Incident 2: 
• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve 
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it 
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. 
• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student 
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored 
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. 
• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without 
mentioning you by name. "There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought 
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me 
upset for weeks afterward," she wrote. 
• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, 
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and 
she did. 
• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. 
• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student 
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: 
"This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment 
policy. 
• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she 
remained at Case. 
11 
• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics 
department before setting foot on the campus again. 
• The letter also stated, "Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also 
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with 
students." 
• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the 
month before. 
• "The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career," 
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031438 
Incident 3: 
• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous 
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. 
Incident 4: 
• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists 
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she 
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. 
• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student 
and volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. 
• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. 
• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a 
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. 
• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. 
• You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the 
table. 
• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She 
crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. 
Incident 5: 
• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were 
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your 
female companion for sex in your cabin. 
• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged 
CFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, 
however. 
Incident 6: 
• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once 
again. 
• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker. 
• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. 
• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her 
right breast. 
• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. "Don't do that," she said. 
• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College 
of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your 
hand in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses 
have confirmed the complainant's account of what happened. 
• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your 
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 
incident. 
• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National 
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting 
appointments. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031439 
• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But 
neither university found against you. 
• "Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate 
the allegations," Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. 
• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an 
inquiry "did not find a violation of university policy." 
• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints 
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general 
counsel, noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. "The 
University did not find either communication to state a credible allegation," Jewett wrote. 
Miscellaneous facts: 
• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort 
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. 
• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent 
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made 
with biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public 
intellectuals. 
• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a 
vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

Hi.. so, here is the event I am still invited to give in Germany. It is Oct 19th. I was previously invited to give a 
major lecture in Heidelberg Oct 14 but they had to cancel it after the university determination re australia was 
publicized by the bitch. That air ticket, which they had paid fo, was about 5250 euros. There is a $900 
cancellation fee, and they have agreed to let me keep the ticket if I pay them 4500 euros. I offered that to the 
other place but they only have $5K USD total, which includes the $4K fee they originally offered me. I am 
going to check other tickets now, but wanted to know if you might be flying to europe around then and could 
take a hitchhiker. :)

Hi Lawrence, 
just back from a long tour ,,on origins". 
As promised you will get my message promptly. 
As you may understand, before we start recruiting for the Festival our budget 
implies more freedom. Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily 
on amounts in „kilos". (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before 
deadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum). 
What I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment. 
I deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines. 
So please let me know if you can or cannot come. 
As ever Jakob

Hi Jakob 
There has been a complication. The Gottingen event had to be cancelled so that means I now do not have an air ticket to Germany. I 
am going to check whether I can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime I 
thought I should let you know and ask whether it is possible to cover part or all of the cost for a ticket.

Hi.. so, here is the event I am still invited to give in Germany. It is Oct 19th. I was previously invited to give a 
major lecture in Heidelberg Oct 14 but they had to cancel it after the university determination re australia was 
publicized by the bitch. That air ticket, which they had paid fo, was about 5250 euros. There is a $900 
cancellation fee, and they have agreed to let me keep the ticket if I pay them 4500 euros. I offered that to the 
other place but they only have $5K USD total, which includes the $4K fee they originally offered me. I am 
going to check other tickets now, but wanted to know if you might be flying to europe around then and could 
take a hitchhiker. :)

Hi Lawrence, 
just back from a long tour ,,on origins". 
As promised you will get my message promptly. 
As you may understand, before we start recruiting for the Festival our budget 
implies more freedom. Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily 
on amounts in „kilos". (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before 
deadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum). 
What I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment. 
I deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines. 
So please let me know if you can or cannot come. 
As ever Jakob

Well it depends on UK.. if they can't do it, then alas, it would be the whole thing.. I could check for a discount 
ticket of course.. and maybe even economy class... There is also a small chance that I might do the event in 
UK with Noam Chomsky, and I am wondering whether, if I could convince him to join me in a dialogue at 
your place whether that might change the dynamics of the event for you, and free up some more money 
perhaps..

I need my financial colleague to decide. So, I shall be

Hi Jakob 
There has been a complication. The G6ttingen event had to be cancelled so that means I now do not have an air ticket to Germany. I 
am going to check whether I can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime I 
thought I should let you know and ask whether it is possible to cover part or all of the cost for a ticket. 
Lawrence.

Hi Lawrence, 
I think we take Journey to the Beginning of Time. 
Could you write two sentences for my colleague to 
make clear where your talk will go for.. 
This may well lay the groundwork for next year's major focus 
on ORIGINES. 
I do look forward to having you here again! 
As ever Jakob

Dear Lawrence Kraus, 
my name is Michael Braun and I am working on the DAI Heidelberg's fall program brochure. 
May I ask you if you settled on a topic for your Heidelberg talk? 
If so, could you send me title and a short abstract for me to include in the brochure and on our website?

The Guardian has learned that Rubenfeld is currently the subject of an internal investigation at Yale. The 
investigation is focused on Rubenfeld's conduct, particularly with female law students. Students have also 
raised related concerns to Yale authorities about Chua's powerful influence in the clerkships process. The 
investigation was initiated before Kavanaugh was nominated by Donald Trump to serve on the high court. 
Rubenfeld said in a statement to the Guardian: "In June, Yale University informed me that it would conduct 
what it terms an 'informal review' of certain allegations, but that to preserve anonymity, I was not entitled to 
know any specifics. As a result, I do not know what I am alleged to have said or done. I was further advised that 
the allegations were not of the kind that would jeopardize my position as a long-tenured member of the faculty.
