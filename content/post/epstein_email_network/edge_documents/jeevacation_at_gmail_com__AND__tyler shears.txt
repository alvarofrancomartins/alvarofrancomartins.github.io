Mr. Epstein, 
We currently have two negatives on first page in Google but one is at 6th and the other at 7th. (Universal 
search, no history applied). Results will be very different if that PC has been used to click or search any of the 
results and has not been cleared. 
How did you pull the results you just sent? 
Using Google Chrome + InCognito Mode + Clearing Browser Cache = only reliable reporting. I can help set 
you up with this. Screenshot here of results using above method - http://i.imgur.com/tfGN3Zi.png. This is the 
true representation of what your average searcher will find (statistically, most searches will be from users whom 
have not clicked on your negative articles before) 
Much progress has been made since we spoke - premium placements are getting secured over next week, 
hundreds of links have been built to your primary sites and the first movements are kicking in today (NYMag 
moved up to 4th a few hours ago). We still have confidence we are on the right track and doing everything we 
can to get this cleaned up - another 45 days should be enough to have a clean first page based on what has been 
done. 
PS - The foundation site was just hacked and I'm in the process of fixing that today. You can actually see it in 
the screenshot above (it reads Cash Advance advertisement in the short-description). This is something a 
previous company deployed but we are now going through and securing the rest of the domains to prevent basic 
hijacks like this. 
I'm free on my cell for next few hours. 
Sincerely, 
Tyler Shears

Understand the two negatives are still present. We are still on track per our last call of 60 days from 1/10 if we 
can get the placement out next week Christina is preparing for us and results continue to respond as they have 
been. 
It takes 30 days for Google to respond in most cases and we ramped up 28 days ago with boosting alternate 
URLs per our call 
We are working very hard to make this happen and should have Christina set up to support us with columns on 
a few top sites at no cost moving forward 
I am available for a call now or this weekend to review.

Thank you Christina - I tried your cell a few minutes ago and will be available on mine at your convenience. It 
is imperative we get a placement out by mid next week in order for us to hit the timeline I spoke to Mr. Epstein 
about.. The fresh piece needs to come out while we are dislodging the current results (as you are observing 
now). 
Mr. Epstein if you have any questions on current status vs. our conversation around Jan 10. please advise - We 
are continuing to work aggressively to clean up results per our last call. I am also available to discuss this at 
your convenience today or over weekend.

Subject: Re: boosting strategy 
We are pushing up the highest authority domains available for "Jeffrey Epstein" in general. I had reserved the 
approach of pushing non-website URLs for a few months because you expressed concern with making sure 
our URLs are on first page... but I had call w/ Mr. Epstein in the beginning of January and expressed that is a 
limiting factor for moving Forbes/NYPost as quickly as we'd like. 
Getting up different types of results for different folks is required to dislodge the negative placements. Once 
they are dislodged it is much easier to restore our websites back to the rankings and have our "ideal" first 
page. The reason for this is Google tracks click data on results and as soon as Forbes/NYPost are on second 
page they will begin a slow death (less clicks on those, more clicks on the ones we have on first page) 
From there we will see our properties shoot up due to the interlinking between them and the reinforcement we 
can provide from sites like Harvard, Nat Geo, and any other publications we have influence over. Using the 
"short-term" links is one battle around other pages is just a part of the overall war... You saw how Google was 
changing up much more dramatically when we had multiple Epstein's on the first page vs. having a saturated 
first page. 
I feel like time was lost focusing on making sure it was Mr. Epstein properties when he has giving explicit 
permission to promote any URL required to dislodge the negatives. 
I hope this makes sense.. I haven't heard from Rich on the last invoice I sent (1/29/14) and am hoping all is 
well. Do you know if he's out of the office ?

I see that you're boosting non-website url's -- are you sure this is the right approach? (vs. boosting Jeffrey's sites?) the 
.org and foundation sites are slipping down and the USVI and science are permanently off the first page.

yes agree 
result got worse with recent negative press, clinton, as we discussed 
we were down to 1 negative (forbes) before that - Christina can confirm this. 
It will get back to 1 and then 0 so long as negative things stop coming out. if new negative keeps coming out it 
really dismantles much of our effort... especially when it involves an ex-president 
no excuses here i'm not pleased with where it is at and am still working to make it happen

Hi Tyler, 
The social media sites are constantly updated: LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, google +. 
I'll be in touch later today re: feature article. 
Could you put a site map into the Net site.? This helps rankings. Also could you add it to google analytics 
using Jeffrey's gmail account? This allows me to monitor it's progress and index it periodically. 
I'll call you later. Thanks,

http://jeffreyepstein.net/ - Site is live and Share This shows up when you scroll down page (look for top menu 
bar) 
I expect this to rank swiftly - I'm sending a list of all properties we need to point over in this direction with 
suggested anchor text. 
Do you have the topic right I'm doing a placement around? I'm going to have a few articles spun-off from it 
and put into lower tier publications as well. 
I want to push HARD in August with a premium placement, fresh link pushes, and some supporting 
placements. We should be able to get down to 1 negative by mid-September with a goal of being clean by end 
of year (unless new negative press comes again...) 
For social media updates... Are you currently doing these? I'd like to look at how often we are doing them and 
trying to link to our own content more often. 
I'm also exploring if we can get this new site included in Google News and maybe syndicate other important 
Al news through it... would give us free google news spots when we need them.. 
JE - There's 3 negatives today and that's 3 too many. There will be progress please continue to be patient as 
you have been.
