      "summary": "RELATIONSHIP:\nMartin Weinberg, acting as legal counsel, forwards high-priority correspondence regarding media inquiries, witness statements, and public relations strategy concerning Jeffrey Epstein to Kathy Ruemmler, likely a fellow legal team member.\n\nKEY TOPICS:\nABC News Allegations: Weinberg shared an inquiry from ABC News regarding an interview with &quot;Jane Doe #3,&quot; who alleged she was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at age 15 and forced to have sex with Epstein and his friends, including Prince Andrew. The allegations also claimed she met Bill Clinton on Epstein&#x27;s island.\n\nWitness Affidavit regarding Clinton: Weinberg circulated an email from Miles Alexander, the island manager from 1999 to 2007, who stated he was willing to sign an affidavit denying that Bill Clinton or Al Gore ever visited Little St. James during his tenure.\n\nMedia Strategy and &quot;Anti-Trump&quot; Pivot: The thread includes advice from Michael Wolff suggesting Epstein create an &quot;immediate counter narrative&quot; to an upcoming James Patterson book by becoming an &quot;anti-Trump voice&quot; to gain &quot;political cover&quot;.\n\nNOTABLE:\nIt is significant that Michael Wolff explicitly advised Epstein that positioning himself as an anti-Trump voice would provide him with political cover he &quot;decidedly [didn&#x27;t] have&quot; at the time."
