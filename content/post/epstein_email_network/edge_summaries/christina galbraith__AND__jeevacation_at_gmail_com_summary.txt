RELATIONSHIP:
Jeffrey Epstein briefly replies to Christina Galbraith, who appears to manage or relay PR-related correspondence to him, indicating a minimal and business-like communication pattern.

KEY TOPICS:
A forwarded message from an acquaintance commenting on Epstein’s recent press attention and congratulating him on his financial success since teaching physics at Dalton.
Epstein responds only to ask what a mutual acquaintance, David, is doing.

NOTABLE:
The email references Epstein being toasted by former associates and nostalgically linked to his past as a Dalton teacher, an uncommon detail in most correspondence.
