RELATIONSHIP:
Roy Black sends two identical FYI messages to Martin Weinberg, reflecting a professional, lawyer-to-lawyer communication pattern focused on coordinating public statements related to Epstein matters.

KEY TOPICS:

Black states they will not comment on the “Trump story” at this time.
He explains they are finalizing a pleading related to the plaintiff’s position on remedies and will only comment publicly after it is filed.
The messages serve as informational updates rather than a request for discussion or action.

NOTABLE:
Both emails are duplicates, each relaying that no public comment will be made until the legal filing is complete.
