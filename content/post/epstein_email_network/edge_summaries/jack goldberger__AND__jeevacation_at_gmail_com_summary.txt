RELATIONSHIP:
Jeffrey Epstein and attorney Jack Goldberger exchange messages primarily to relay media inquiries and legal developments, reflecting a direct, utilitarian communication pattern focused on managing press and litigation risk. 

KEY TOPICS:
Forwarding extensive press questions from the *New York Daily News* regarding allegations of sexual abuse, Ghislaine Maxwell’s role, lawsuits brought by multiple Jane Does, accusations of intimidation, and the implications of Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement. 
Media inquiries involving a 2016 federal lawsuit alleging rape by Epstein and Donald Trump, with Reuters requesting comment or an interview. 
A BBC request seeking an interview with Epstein to address stories in the UK press about him and Prince Andrew. 

NOTABLE:
The messages consist almost entirely of high-stakes media inquiries containing detailed, explicit allegations, indicating Goldberger’s role as a legal gatekeeper for Epstein’s public exposure.
