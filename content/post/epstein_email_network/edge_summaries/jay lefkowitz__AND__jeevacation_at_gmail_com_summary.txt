RELATIONSHIP:
Jeffrey Epstein and attorney Jay Lefkowitz communicate professionally about managing press inquiries, with Lefkowitz acting as an intermediary between reporters and Epstein. 

KEY TOPICS:
A reporter from *The Wall Street Journal* sends Lefkowitz an extensive list of interview questions covering Epstein’s business activities, time in prison, social life, scientific foundation, ties to Ghislaine Maxwell, and charitable work with Bill Clinton. 
Lefkowitz insists that all factual questions be routed through him due to inaccurate or defamatory prior coverage, offering to provide controlled responses. 
Epstein forwards the message back to Lefkowitz, indicating he is reviewing the inquiry but providing no direct answers. 

NOTABLE:
The reporter’s questions probe deeply into Epstein’s activities and relationships, reflecting early efforts by major media to scrutinize him years before later scandals exploded publicly.
