RELATIONSHIP:
Peggy Siegal and Steven Pfeiffer communicate in a professional, transactional manner to coordinate donation logistics and event attendance for the 2017 IFP Gotham Awards.

KEY TOPICS:

Pfeiffer requests organizational details needed to issue an invoice and donation letter for a $10,000 contribution tied to event seating (“chairs”).
Siegal (through her assistant Rebecca) provides the required company name, contact, and address information.
The thread includes messages from Jeffrey confirming the donation, specifying seating needs, and directing that correspondence be handled through Siegal.

NOTABLE:
Jeffrey’s donation and direction to route all administrative details to Siegal shape the entire exchange, making Siegal the central point of coordination for a high-value event contribution.
