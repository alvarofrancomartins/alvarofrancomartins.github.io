RELATIONSHIP:
Jeffrey Epstein and Fred Haddad exchange short, mostly forwarded messages, indicating a minimal but direct line of communication focused on relaying urgent media inquiries.

KEY TOPICS:
Multiple forwarded requests from *The Mail on Sunday* seeking comment on allegations involving underage victims, intimidation claims, and high-profile figures such as Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton.
Coordination around responding—if at all—to these press inquiries, with Epstein forwarding material back to Haddad for awareness or action.

NOTABLE:
All messages center on one highly sensitive media request, repeatedly circulated among the parties with no added discussion, underscoring the urgency and gravity of the allegations.
