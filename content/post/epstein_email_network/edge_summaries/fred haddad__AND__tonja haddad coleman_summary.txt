RELATIONSHIP:
Fred Haddad forwards media inquiries to Tonja Haddad Coleman, indicating a direct, informational communication pattern likely tied to shared legal or advisory responsibilities.

KEY TOPICS:
A reporter from *The Mail on Sunday* requests comment on allegations involving underage victims, accusations of intimidation, and claims connecting Jeffrey Epstein to Prince Andrew and President Clinton.
Repeated forwarding of the same inquiry to ensure Coleman is aware of the press deadline and the sensitive nature of the requested comment.

NOTABLE:
Both emails are nearly identical forwardings of the same high-stakes media request, suggesting urgency or an attempt to ensure it reached Coleman without delay.
