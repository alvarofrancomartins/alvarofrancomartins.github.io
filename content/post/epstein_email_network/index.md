## Overview

On November 12th, 2025, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released 20,000 pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, containing extensive email correspondence.

This post analyzes that email data by combining graph analysis with artificial intelligence. The visualization uses k-core decomposition to identify Epstein's most densely connected contacts and leverages large language models to automatically generate relationship summaries from the email content.
