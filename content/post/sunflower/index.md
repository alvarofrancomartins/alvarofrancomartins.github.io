I made this creative visualization comparing monthly sunlight across some Brazilian capitals.

Each city’s “sunflower” shows how sunshine hours vary through the year. Petal size & width reflect monthly sunlight intensity. To enhance visual contrast, I applied a nonlinear scaling, so differences between months become easier to see.
