I'm a **physicist** working on **data science** and **complex networks**. I have a particular interest in the application of statistical data analysis to uncover patterns in data sets related to **criminal activity** and **organized crime**.

<br>

I hold both a bachelor's (2018) and a master's degree (2021) in Physics from the State University of Maringá, where I'm currently pursuing a PhD. I work on the project “Network and data science applied to study corruption and organized crime”, related to the _Academic Cooperation Program (PROCAD) in Public Security and Forensic Sciences_. My primary goal is to extract meaningful patterns from data on criminal activities, uncovering rules and mechanisms that govern their structure and dynamics.
