  description = """**Thesis**: [The dynamics of political corruption networks](https://alvarofrancomartins.com/uploads/redes_corrupcao_politica.pdf) <br><br> <p>  Here I investigated the dynamical structure of political corruption networks through the lens of data and network science. I have found surprising patterns, such as linearity in the evolution of community structures and a coalescence-like process regarding the emergence of these networks. After unveiling these and many other statistical similarities in the growth of corruption networks, we have proposed a model for the evolution of artificial networks that simulate real political corruption networks. <p>"""
