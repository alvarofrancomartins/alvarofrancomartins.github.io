During this work, I have found surprising patterns, such as linearity in the evolution of community structures and an emergent process regarding the evolution of these networks. After finding several statistical similarities in the growth of corruption networks, we have proposed a model for the evolution of artificial networks that simulate real political corruption networks. <p>"""
