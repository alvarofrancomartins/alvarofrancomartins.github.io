I was able to found surprising results, such as linearity in the evolution of community structures, patterns regarding the growth of recidivist criminals and a coalescence-like process present in the emergence of these networks. After unveiling these and many other statistical similarities between corruption networks, we proposed a model of artificial networks capable of simulating realistic political corruption networks.
