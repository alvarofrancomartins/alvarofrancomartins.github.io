Swiss Accounts Survey 
Dear Mr Epstein, 
We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in 
London, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present. 
It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and 
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. 
There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, UK 
domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money. 
We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts 
contained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include: 
HSBC (Suisse) SA 
FAMILY INTEREST L.P. 
22079 
BESSIE 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
1) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money. 
We will be particularly concerned with these questions: 
2) Why you had Swiss accounts. 
3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. 
Additionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that: 
4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were 
sentenced to 18 months in prison. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030336 
5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr Leslie Wexner. 
6) You are known to be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and 
Kevin Spacey. 
7) You have made substantial contributions to the Clintons' philanthropic causes. Tax reform campaigners 
have previously been critical of those who engage in public life or the political process while avoiding or 
evading tax. Hilary Clinton herself, speaking in 2012, noted the importance of elites paying a substantial share 
of tax: "One of the issues that I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an equitable 
manner — especially from the elites in every country." 
It is intended shortly to publish the results of our survey in both the US and the UK. 
As responsible journalists acting in the public interest, we would first like to give you the opportunity to 
comment. 
If we do not hear from you by 18:00 on Monday 12th January 2015 (preferably by email to 
we shall proceed on the basis that you do not wish to comment on or amend 
our information. 
But we have approached you in a straightforward fashion and hope you will take this opportunity to respond if 
you wish. Your substantive responses to each of our numbered points will be carefully considered and 
published if appropriate. 
(For the avoidance of doubt, we do not normally regard any generalised assertion of "inaccuracies" as a 
substantive response; nor any generalised statement that the holders acted on advice. Neither will we regard as 
substantive any comment that only refers to the present state of affairs and not to the past.) 
We are, of course, happy to discuss directly any concerns you may have. 
We would be most grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter. This will save us from chasing.

From: Michael Wolff

Subject: Patterson 
To: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> 
A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be 
able to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In 
a sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I 
have some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting 
you frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and 
technical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something 
along the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and 
perhaps some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, 
expensive effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll 
surely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032250 
amp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've 
encountered before. 
Meanwhile--
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's "authorship" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

Ending years of speculation about how much Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein  
paid young women who claimed he used them as sex toys, court documents filed last 
week show he shelled out $5.5 million to settle lawsuits with three of more than two 
dozen teens who sued him. 
Responding to requests from Epstein's attorneys in a complex lawsuit that was 
spawned by the sex scandal, attorney Bradley Edwards said the politically-
connected 64-year-old convicted sex offender paid more than $1 million to each of 
the three women Edwards represented. 
Identified in court papers only by their initials or pseudonyms because of the nature 
of the allegations and their youthful ages, L.M. was paid $1 million, E.W. $2 million 
and Jane Doe $2.5 million, Edwards said of the settlements he negotiated with 
Epstein to end the lawsuits. 
Jack Goldberger, one of Epstein's criminal defense attorneys, on Tuesday declined 
comment on the revelations, citing confidentiality agreements that were part of the 
settlements. For the same reason, he declined to say whether Epstein paid similar 
amounts to settle roughly two dozen lawsuits filed by other young women against 
Epstein, claiming he paid them for sex when some were as young as 14 years old. 
Attorney Jack Scarola, who is representing Edwards, said his client was compelled 
to divulge the confidential settlements to answer questions posed by Epstein's 
attorneys. "Brilliant move on their part," he said. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029860 
Even if Epstein's attorneys hadn't opened the door, Scarola said the information 
would have likely come out. He says the information will help him undermine 
Epstein's claims that Edwards "ginned up" the allegations to help his former law 
partner, imprisoned and disbarred Fort Lauderdale lawyer Scott Rothstein, 
perpetuate a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. 
The revelations of the settlements came as part of an ongoing lawsuit that started as 
a dispute between Epstein and Rothstein, both billionaires. 
A year after Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and 
procuring a minor for prostitution, he sued Rothstein and Edwards, claiming they 
trumped up the allegations of sexual molestation to perpetuate the Ponzi scheme. 
Rothstein was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2010 after admitting he had built 
his wildly successful law firm by forging the names of federal judges and others to 
persuade investors he had negotiated settlements in lawsuits against high-profile 
people. Investors were told they could get a cut of the cash. 
One of the high-profile people Rothstein used to lure investors was Epstein, 
according to a lawsuit West Palm Beach attorney Robert Critton filed on Epstein's 
behalf. According to the lawsuit, Rothstein told investors Epstein, a money 
manager, had agreed to settle the lawsuits with the teens for 8200 million — a claim 
Critton described as "a complete fabrication." 
After Epstein dropped the lawsuit in 2012, Edwards turned the tables on him. 
Edwards accused Epstein of filing the lawsuit maliciously to punish him for 
representing the young women. Although Edwards was a partner in Rothstein's now 
defunct firm, Scarola claims Epstein had no evidence Edwards was involved in the 
Ponzi scheme. Federal prosecutors successfully charged other attorneys and 
members of the firm, but Edwards was never implicated, Scarola said in the 
malicious prosecution lawsuit. 
The revelations about the money Epstein paid to three of the young woman came 
last week in documents filed for a hearing Tuesday in preparation for a December 
trial on the lawsuit. 
Attorney Tonja Haddad Coleman, who represents Epstein, on Tuesday sought a 
delay of the trial, in part, because she claimed she has been unable to talk to her 
client since his estate on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands was devastated 
last month by Hurricane Irma. "I've had no ability to communicate with Mr. 
Epstein," she said. 
Pointing out Epstein's enormous wealth and his private jet, Palm Beach County 
Circuit Judge Donald Hafele rejected her request. While saying he didn't want to 
appear insensitive to those victimized by the storm that hammered the Caribbean 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029861 
and roared through South Florida, he said Coleman offered no proof, such as an 
affidavit from Epstein, to shore up her claims. 
Still, Hafele gave Coleman extra time to respond to various motions that he will have 
to decide before the case goes to trial. 
Despite Scarola's insistence that Edwards had nothing to do with Rothstein's Ponzi 
scheme, Coleman said the evidence indicates otherwise. Why else would he try to 
depose Epstein's well-known friends, such as now President Donald Trump, former 
President Bill Clinton and illusionist David Copperfield, she asked. He used the 
celebrities as a draw, she said. 
"The Epstein cases were used to fleece money and defraud investors," she said. 
Edward's malicious prosecution case has been difficult for both sides because both 
Epstein and Edwards have refused to answer questions. As he did in the civil 
lawsuits, Epstein has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 
when questioned by Scarola. Edwards has claimed that much of the information 
Epstein is seeking is protected by attorney-client privilege. 
The malicious prosecution lawsuit is one of two hotly-contested lawsuits that 
continue to pit Edwards against Epstein. Edwards also is suing the U.S. attorney's 
office, claiming it violated the federal Crime Victims Rights Act when it negotiated a 
non-prosecution agreement with Epstein. 
Only after federal prosecutors agreed to drop their investigation of Epstein, did he 
agree to plead guilty to two prostitution charges in Palm Beach County Circuit 
Court. In federal court records, prosecutors claim one of the key reasons they agreed 
to drop their case was Epstein's agreement to settle lawsuits filed against him by 
dozens of his underage victims.

Top aide of Jeffrey Epstein 
prosecutor Acosta: We acted with 
integrity 
February 15, 2019 12:17 PM 
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. By Emily Michot I Julie K. Brown  
A former top prosecutor involved in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case is defending his old 
boss, Alexander Acosta, whose decision to craft a secret plea deal with the wealthy 
New York hedge fund manager has come under federal scrutiny. 
In his first public comments on the 10-year-old case, Jeffrey H. Sloman — who at 
the time was second in command under Acosta at the U.S. Attorney's Office in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023126 
Miami — said prosecutors resolved the case based on the facts and evidence, and 
what he called "legal impediments," including the belief that many of Epstein's 
teenage victims were too "terrified" to cooperate in the case. 
"Given the obstacles we faced in fashioning a robust federal prosecution, we decided 
to negotiate a resolution," said Sloman, now in private practice. "We did not reach 
this decision lightly and it came only after significant and often rancorous internal 
debate." 
Jeffrey Sloman, who was second-in-command to then-U.S. Attorney Alexander 
Acosta when the latter was deciding whether to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein, says the 
office handled the case properly. Aixa Montero Holt 
In a lengthy opinion piece  submitted to the Miami Herald Editorial Board, Sloman 
alleges that the attacks on Acosta's role in the controversial case are politically 
driven by critics who failed to raise significant issues when Acosta was nominated 
and confirmed as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017. 
Sloman's comments come two weeks after the Justice Department announced it had 
opened an investigation over whether there was prosecutorial misconduct in the 
case involving Epstein, who ran a sex pyramid scheme from his Palm Beach estate 
that targeted scores of underage girls from 2001 to 2006. 
About 30 members of Congress demanded the probe following a Miami Herald 
series of stories, "Perversion of Justice," that detailed how federal prosecutors, led 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023127 
by Acosta, stitched together an unusual immunity deal that allowed Epstein to 
escape what could have been a life sentence in federal prison. 
U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta has been criticized for the plea deal he 
worked out with Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta was U.S. attorney for Southern Florida at 
the time. Alan Diaz 
Instead, Epstein — whose friends included President Donald Trump, former 
President Bill Clinton and other politically connected people — was allowed to 
quietly plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court. He served 13 months in 
the county jail, where he was allowed liberal work release privileges rarely given to 
sex offenders in Florida and barred by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Department's own 
rules. 
He was released in 2009, but his victims — who were 13 to 16 years old at the time — 
are still fighting more than a decade later to have his non-prosecution agreement 
overturned. 
In his op-ed, Sloman called Acosta "an outstanding public servant ... at risk of 
becoming collateral damage in Washington's latest polarized conflagration," adding, 
"I won't let it happen without first being heard." 
Jeffrey Epstein apologizes, but not to his victims 
Jeffrey Epstein, a multimillionaire who molested dozens of underage girls, and is 
suspected of trafficking countless other girls around the world, issued a public 
apology Tuesday. It was not to the victims of his abuse, but to one of their lawyers. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023128 
"As additional details about Epstein's crimes have emerged, it is clear to me that we 
should have pushed for much harsher terms," Sloman wrote. "That said, some have 
mistakenly suggested that our office kowtowed to Epstein's high-priced defense 
lawyers or, worse, that his lawyers corrupted or intimidated us into submission. ... 
Nothing could be further from the truth." 
Sloman did not directly address the chief complaint brought by Epstein's victims, 
who are now in their late 20S and early 30s. Those who spoke to the Herald said 
they felt betrayed by federal prosecutors, who sealed the non-prosecution agreement 
from public view so that they wouldn't find out about it before he was sentenced. It 
would be almost a year before they were successful in having it unsealed. By then, it 
was too late to try to derail it. 
They allege, in a federal lawsuit filed against the government, that prosecutors 
deliberately kept the deal secret — in violation of federal law — to prevent them 
from appearing at Epstein's sentencing to possibly undo the deal. Nor did Sloman 
address why prosecutors also gave immunity to a number of Epstein's co-
conspirators, who have never been identified. 
"They cut a deal which they have to know was a failure," said Marci Hamilton, a law 
professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of Child USA, 
which advocates for children's civil liberties. " They kept it secret and they didn't 
charge the co-conspirators. The horror of this is if you don't hold all the 'Johns' 
accountable, then it doesn't stop. This case involved multiple girls, multiple men, 
multiple recruiters, multiple times and he recruited girls to get other girls. That's a 
trafficking organization." 
Acosta has not commented since 2011, when he defended his decisions in a publicly 
issued letter that can be found in the federal court file. In it, he described what he 
called a "yearlong assault" on prosecutors by Epstein's "army of legal superstars," 
including Roy Black, Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz, among others. In four 
long paragraphs, Acosta detailed how defense attorneys relentlessly worked to 
manipulate the negotiation process, often frustrating prosecutors. 
"They would obtain concessions as part of a negotiation and agree to proceed, only 
to change their minds, and appeal the office's decision to Washington," Acosta 
wrote, adding that their tactics included delving into the private family lives of 
individual prosecutors in an effort to discredit them and get them removed from the 
case. 
Wrote Sloman: "The Herald's 'Perversion of Justice' series presented a heartrending 
portrait of Epstein's victims and made a strong case that he should have gone to jail 
much longer, but never explained or substantiated its accusation that we schemed 
with Epstein's lawyers." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023129 
The Herald's series quoted a trove of letters and emails between prosecutors and 
Epstein's defense team that showed that Epstein's lawyers were allowed to dictate 
the terms of each deal that they drew up, and prosecutors repeatedly backed down 
on deadlines. The lead prosecutor, Marie Villafaria, amid the negotiations wrote to 
Epstein lawyer Jay Lefkowitz: "I thought we had worked very well together in 
resolving this dispute. ... I feel that I bent over backwards to keep in mind the effect 
that the agreement would have on Mr. Epstein." 
Where are they now? The biggest players in the Jeffrey Epstein case 
The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their 
cause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's 
employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have 
prospered. 
The email chain also shows that prosecutors sometimes communicated with the 
defense team using private emails, and that their correspondence referenced 
discussions that they wanted to have by phone or in person so that there would be 
no paper trail, the Herald found. At one point, Acosta met privately with Lefkowitz, 
who came from the same Washington, D.C.-based law firm, at a Marriott hotel in 
West Palm Beach, the emails showed. It was at that meeting, the records show, 
when Acosta agreed to keep the deal secret. 
The correspondences also show that Sloman sought several times to have Epstein's 
victims notified about the deal, as required under the Crime Victims Rights Act. But 
after Epstein's lawyers aggressively objected and appealed to Acosta, it never 
happened. 
Sloman, however, insisted that Epstein's lawyers' aggressive defense had no bearing 
on the office's decision to set aside what court records show was a 53-page federal 
indictment it had prepared against Epstein. Sloman said the facts dictated that 
Epstein should plead guilty to what he called "a crime in state court that reflected 
his true conduct," adding that the case was "at heart, a local sex case." 
"It is a gross mischaracterization to describe this as a local sex case," said lawyer 
Jack Scarola, a representative of several of Epstein's then-underage victims. "There 
was ample evidence that Epstein was operating on a large international scale. The 
involvement of the federal government was a consequence of evidence that children 
were crossing national and state borders for the purpose of prostitution." 
At the time that the case was closed, FBI investigators had identified nearly 40 
victims — and more were coming forward — who said they had been molested or 
sexually assaulted by Epstein and some of his co-conspirators. One of those victims, 
Courtney Wild, told the Herald that she brought at least 6o girls to his waterfront 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023130 
Palm Beach estate over time. She wanted Epstein prosecuted — and was willing to 
testify — but prosecutors never gave her the chance, she told the Herald. 
In addition, FBI records show that agents had traveled to New York and New 
Mexico to interview other possible victims, the Herald found. The non-prosecution 
deal that was struck was filed under seal. The result was that no one — not even the 
judge — would know the full scope of Epstein's crimes and how many victims were 
involved. 
Acosta, who now heads a federal agency with oversight of international child labor 
laws and human trafficking, was personally involved in the negotiations, records, 
letters and emails show. 
AG nominee Barr pledges to look into handling of Epstein case 
Sen. Ben Sasse questioned attorney general nominee William Barr about the Jeffrey 
Epstein case on January 15, 2019, getting the nominee to commit to having the 
Department of Justice look into the handling of that case if confirmed. 
By C-SPAN 
Sloman reiterated Acosta's earlier contention that most of Epstein's victims 
wouldn't cooperate. 
"So somehow, had Epstein been a child molester of one or two victims, then they 
would have prosecuted him?" said Wild's attorney, Brad Edwards, in an interview 
with the Herald for its series published in November. "But because he molested 
hundreds of victims and some of them wouldn't testify, then they are saying, 'we 
can't prosecute.' How absurd is that argument?" 
Edwards tried unsuccessfully to block the plea deal in federal court. In 2008, days 
after Epstein was sentenced, he filed an emergency order, alleging that the 
agreement was illegal because it violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which 
grants crime victims certain rights, including the right to confer with prosecutors 
and be notified of a plea deal. The lawsuit is still pending a decade later. 
"There is a reason for the Crime Victims Rights Act — so that prosecutors don't 
preempt a victim's ability to speak for themselves about a proposed plea bargain," 
Scarola said. "Here, the decision was being made secretly for them."

For years, Jeffrey Epstein abused teen girls, police say. A 
timeline of his case 
PERVERSION 
ofJUSTIC 
A decade before #MeToo, a multimillionaire sex offender from Florida got the 
ultimate break. 
2005 
March: A 14-year-old girl and her parents report that Jeffrey Epstein molested her 
at a mansion in Palm Beach. She said a female acquaintance and classmate at Royal 
Palm Beach High School had taken her to the house to give him a massage in 
exchange for money. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023002 
Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly engaged in sexual activity with underage girls at his 
waterfront Palm Beach home on El Brillo Way, according to police in the Town of 
Palm Beach. Epstein also owns residences in New York City and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, among other locales. Emily Michot emichotPmiamiherald.com  
April: Palm Beach police begin trash pulls at Epstein's home, discovering a 
telephone message for Epstein with the girl's name on it, and a time that matched 
the time that she told police she was there. They find the names and phone numbers 
of other girls on message slips in his trash. 
October: With the police probe in full swing, one of Epstein's assistants calls one of 
the girls just as she is being questioned by police. Investigators begin interviewing 
more girls, as well as Epstein's butlers, who tell them that Epstein had frequent 
visits from girls throughout the day. On Oct. 20, they execute a search warrant at his 
house on El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. 
2006 
May: Police sign a probable cause affidavit charging Epstein and two of his 
assistants with multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor. The Palm Beach 
state attorney, Barry Krischer, instead refers the case to a grand jury. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023003

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023004 
Palm Beach police were unhappy with the handling of the Epstein case by then-State 
Attorney Barry Krischer. 
June: The grand jury, after hearing from only one girl, returns an indictment of one 
count of solicitation of prostitution. The charge does not reflect that the victim in 
question and others were minors. 
July: Epstein's powerhouse legal team tries to negotiate a deal with the State 
Attorney's Office. Lawyers discuss a deferred prosecution in which Epstein would 
enter a pretrial intervention program and serve no jail time. 
July: After pressure from the Palm Beach police chief, the FBI opens a federal 
investigation, dubbed "Operation Leap Year." Documents list the possible crime as 
"child prostitution." 
November: The FBI begins interviewing potential witnesses and victims from 
Florida, New York and New Mexico. 
2007 
May: As the U.S. Attorney's Office prepares to present the case to a federal grand 
jury, Epstein's attorneys request a meeting to discuss the investigation. 
June: A 53-page indictment is prepared by the U.S. Attorney's Office as, 
simultaneously, plea negotiations are initiated with Epstein's legal team. 
July: Grand jury subpoenas are issued for Epstein's computers, which were 
apparently removed from his Palm Beach home prior to the police search. 
August: The U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, enters into direct 
discussions about the plea agreement; a motion to compel production of Epstein's 
computers is delayed. 
September: Federal prosecutors draw up several federal plea agreements that are 
rejected by Epstein and his attorneys. Epstein signs a non-prosecution agreement 
on Sept. 24, but his attorneys continue to delay his court appearance. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023005 
Alexander Acosta has been criticized for his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case as 
U.S. attorney. He later became the dean of Florida International University's law 
school and, later still, President Trump's secretary of labor. Miami Herald file photo 
October: With the non-prosecution agreement still being debated, Acosta meets 
with Epstein lawyer Jay Lefkowitz at the West Palm Beach Marriott on Okeechobee 
Road to discuss finalizing a deal. Among the terms agreed upon: that the victims 
would not be notified, that the deal would be kept under seal and all grand jury 
subpoenas would be canceled. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023006 
The Marriott hotel in West Palm Beach, at 1001 Okeechobee Blvd., is where U.S. 
Attorney Alexander Acosta met with Jeffrey Epstein's attorney to work out a plea 
arrangement. Emily Michot emichotPmiamiherald.com  
November: Epstein's lawyers object to an addendum to the agreement. The 
provision called for a special master to appoint an attorney to represent Epstein 
victims' rights to civil compensation. 
December: The two sides continue to debate the addendum. Epstein attorney 
Kenneth Starr asks for a review of the agreement by the U.S. Department of Justice 
in Washington, further delaying its execution. Victims are told the investigation is 
continuing. 
2008 
January: Epstein attorney, Lefkowitz, calls Acosta, telling him his client will not go 
through with the agreement because it requires him to register as a sex offender. 
February: With the plea negotiations and the Justice Department review still in 
limbo, the FBI continues its probe, locating more witnesses and evidence. 
March: Preparations are made for a new federal grand jury presentation. In court 
documents, the U.S. Attorney's Office notes that Epstein's victims are being 
harassed by his lawyers, who are not specifically named. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023007 
May: The Justice Department issues finding that, if a plea deal is not reached, 
Epstein can be federally prosecuted. 
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. 
June: Epstein's lawyers revisit plea negotiations, and on June 30, Epstein appears 
in a Palm Beach County courtroom. He pleads guilty to state charges: one count of 
solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor 
under the age of 18. He is sentenced to 18 months in jail, followed by a year of 
community control or house arrest. He is adjudicated as a convicted sex offender 
who must register twice a year in Florida. 
July: Epstein's victims learn about his plea in state court after the fact. They file an 
emergency petition to force federal prosecutors to comply with the federal Crime 
Victims' Rights Act, which mandates certain rights for crime victims, including the 
right to be informed about plea agreements and the right to appear at sentencing. 
August: Epstein's victims learn that he has already been sent to jail, and that the 
federal investigation is over. They seek to have his plea agreement unsealed, but 
federal prosecutors argue against releasing the agreement, commencing a yearlong 
court battle to learn the terms of Epstein's plea bargain. 
October: Epstein begins work release from the county stockade. He is picked up by 
his private driver six days a week and transported to an office in West Palm Beach, 
where he accepts visitors for up to 12 hours a day. He returns to the stockade in the 
evenings to sleep.

He must register as a sex offender and is on probation for a year, confined to his 
Palm Beach home except to travel to his office in West Palm Beach. However, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023008 
records show he frequently makes trips to Manhattan and to his home in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. 
August: Palm Beach Police Capt. George Frick finds Epstein walking along AiA in 
the middle of the afternoon, when he was supposed to be at work in his office in 
downtown West Palm Beach. Epstein says he is walking to work, even though the 
location where he is found is not a direct route to his office. His probation officer 
says Epstein has permission to get some exercise. 
September: The federal non-prosecution agreement is made public. By 
September, at least a dozen civil lawsuits have been filed by women who allege they 
were molested by Epstein when they were underage. Epstein begins the process of 
settling them out of court.

Rodriguez, did, for obstruction of justice. He was busted for hiding Epstein's journal 
and trying to sell it. He has since died. © Facebook 
November: One of Epstein's former butlers tries to sell to an undercover FBI agent 
a black book filled with the names of hundreds of girls and young women that 
Epstein allegedly procured for sex and massages. The butler tells FBI agents he 
witnessed nude underage girls at Epstein's pool and had known that the millionaire 
was having sex with them. He also said he saw pornography involving underage girls 
on Epstein's computers. The butler/houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, is later charged 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023010 
with obstruction of justice and sentenced to federal prison. He dies in 2015. The 
contents of the black book become public as part of several civil lawsuits. 
2010 
April: Flight logs obtained as part of civil lawsuits against Epstein show an 
assortment of politicians, academics, celebrities, heads of state and world leaders 
flying on Epstein's jets in the early 2000s. Among them: former President Bill 
Clinton, former national security adviser Sandy Berger, former Colombian President 
Andres Pastrana and lawyer Alan Dershowitz. 
2011 
March: Two of Epstein's victims file a motion in federal court accusing the 
government of violating their rights by failing to notify them about the plea deal and 
keeping it secret. Among other things, they want the plea deal invalidated in the 
hopes of sending Epstein to prison. They accuse federal prosecutors of deceiving 
them with "false notification letters." 
September: U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra rejects the U.S. Attorney's Office 
argument that it was under no obligation to notify victims prior to striking a non-
prosecution agreement with Epstein because there were no federal charges filed 
against him. The decision marks a victory for Epstein's victims, but the case will 
drag on for seven more years. 
November: Epstein must register in New York as the highest and most dangerous 
level of sex offender, despite efforts by him and the New York District Attorney's 
office to lower the classification. A Level 3 status means "high risk of repeat offense 
and a threat to public safety exists," according to the state's guidelines. 
2012 
March-December: Calling himself a "celebrated philanthropist" and a "renowned 
educational investor," Epstein undertakes a public relations campaign to counter 
bad press about his sexual exploits. His foundation donates millions to scientific 
research and sponsors global conferences on ways to achieve world peace and save 
the planet. He funds cancer and educational research projects around the country. 
2015 
Virginia Roberts was working at Mar-a-Lago when she was recruited to be a 
masseuse to Palm Beach hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein. She was lured into a 
life of depravity and sexual abuse. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023011 
January: Virginia Roberts files court papers in Florida claiming that she was 
forced by Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew and lawyer Alan Dershowitz when 
she was underage. In a sworn affidavit, she provides photographs of her with the 
prince and with Epstein's close associate, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. She 
claims Maxwell worked as Epstein's madam, which she denies. Dershowitz and the 
prince deny her claims as well, setting off a series of legal actions between 
Dershowitz and Roberts' attorneys that are later resolved in an out-of-court 
settlement. 
April: A federal judge rules that Roberts cannot join the federal Crime Victims' 
Rights Act lawsuit and that her affidavit — accusing Prince Andrew and Dershowitz 
of having sex with her when she was underage — be stricken from the case. 
Dershowitz said the ruling meant he was vindicated. However, the judge does not 
address the veracity of Roberts' claims, writing: "The factual details regarding with 
whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and 
impertinent to this central claim." 
September: Roberts sues Maxwell in federal court in New York, claiming that 
Epstein's alleged madam defamed her in public statements in the media. The 
lawsuit is widely viewed as a vessel for Epstein's victims to expose the scope of 
Epstein's crimes. Several civil lawsuits filed the same year allege that Epstein and 
Maxwell operated an international sex trafficking operation.

June: A lawsuit is filed in Manhattan by a woman who once used the name Katie 
Johnson, claiming that she was raped by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump 
at a party at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 1994 when she was 13 years old. 
Trump and Epstein both categorically deny it ever happened.

said Bradley Edwards, shown here, who is representing some of the victims of serial 
sex abuser and Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Emily Michot 
emichotPmiamiherald.com  
November: Johnson backs out of a press conference just days before Election Day, 
saying she had been threatened and was fearful. She later drops the lawsuit. 
2017 
February: President Trump nominates former Miami federal prosecutor Acosta as 
U.S. secretary of labor. Acosta is compelled at his confirmation hearing to briefly 
address questions about the deal he approved for Epstein. One lawmaker requests 
more records from the Epstein case. Acosta is confirmed. 
June: Roberts settles her lawsuit with Maxwell for an undisclosed sum. 
2018 
December: Civil trial is scheduled in Palm Beach County Court on Bradley 
Edwards' allegations that Epstein sued him to punish him for representing several 
of his victims. The malicious-prosecution lawsuit is set to begin Dec. 4. Epstein has 
indicated he will not appear in court for trial.
