Subject: Re: Library 
<1= 
Dear Richard, 
For the first time in my life, I am facing the real prospect of dismissal from the project. 
This is due mainly to misunderstanding. 
Mr. Epstein came today and told me very bluntly that he is annoyed with me not doing the job. I prepared one column for him 
and the several feet of decorative molding, but this was a miss. He told me it looks like it was done yesterday. 
This is the very first time that I work like this. I did several projects for French customers in Greenwich, Conn., but always I 
produced the sample and than work 
according to the samples. The paneling I work on were early 19 c. so even the oak looked different. Even at the White House, 
when I was restoring Blue Room, which you can look at it on my Website, www.brandonthompsonrestoration.com I produced 
design, made samples and did the project. President Clinton told me this is the most beautiful Room, he was clearly 
impressed. 
This time I know exactly what Mr. Epstein wants. However it might be too late. He will come tomorrow to check. 
Today I did a lot of prep work for tomorrow. I will go tonight to work on some of the columns but the night light is deceiving 
and I may miss the last chance he gave me. 
So far I was rated the best finisher, until now I guess. 
Warm regards 
Brandon

Dear Richard, 
the samples are ready for approval. I finished one column about 95%, as I want to put some accents on it but after I discuss it 
with Mr. Epstein. I also finished upper section above the blackboard. I also finished some other columns, not completely, 
because I need the approval. My feeling is that someone was already working in the Library, as I can see a lot of waxing done. 
I finished one column so it will correspond with the rest of the decor. You can not remove the whitish color completely. 
There are some "bald" columns, which in my opinion do not sort of belong to the Library any more as they are completely 
brown. Everything has to have at least an shadow of what is around. The top carving, moldings columns and other elements 
in the Library, have to "bond" together. The upper small carvings, have to be finished individually, as a play between the 
whitish color and natural brown color of oak wood. I sort of model the shapes of the crabs, snails and other creatures and 
they come alive. I think I did good work but Mr. Epstein needs to approve it so I can go ahead and finish the project. 
Kindly, 
Brandon

I prepared some samples for Mr. Epstein for today. I did not waist time as there is a lot of work in the Library. However, I 
need his approval to continue. Tonight I will go back and start installation of the doors and panels.

Dear Richard, 
I am not sure whether the photos depict the column right. I looked at it and does not do the justice to what you have on 
the column. I hope you can see the details like even changing the white areas into rubbed ones and emphasising crabs. 
Making the rope "wet" looking, contrasting the rubbed areas with white, and looking at the entire column as a whole. 
All the columns are looking different, as somebody would work previously on them, and some of them are over-rubbed, 
some of them are not rubbed at all. The upper part also, I prepared a sample, so Mr. Epstein can see the difference.

Top 10 Media Stocks for 2015 
By Dan Moskowitz March 19, 2015 AAA 
Oat' 
The following list is broken down into Top-Tier Media Stocks and Speculative Media Stocks. It might surprise 
you that some of the names on the latter list aren't on the former list, but there is a simple reason for this, which 
will be revealed below. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024252 
Top-Tier Media Stocks 
Walt Disney 
The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is one of the strongest brands in the world. It also possesses multiple revenue 
streams and pricing power. Q1 EPS jumped 23% year over year based on record revenue. When a company 
delivers record revenue, that trend doesn't make a sudden U-turn. If there's going to be a turnaround for the 
worse, it will take time to play out, giving you time to exit your position. (For related reading, see: This 
Company Is No Mickey Mouse Operation.) 
CBS 
CBS Corp.'s (CBS) Q4 revenue increased 3% and diluted EPS improved 8%. CBS also announced a $1 billion 
share buyback in the first quarter. This will significantly reduce the share count, which should improve 
earnings. CBS will once again have Thursday Night Football, and it will be the home of Super Bowl 50. It's 
also home to regular-season NFL games, March Madness and The Masters. However, its reach goes well 
beyond sports. 
Comcast 
FY2014 revenue at Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) increased 6.4%. Operating cash flow and EPS improved 6.9% 
and 25%, respectively. Comcast also increased its dividend 11% and announced that $4.25 billion of its $10 
billion share buyback program would take place in 2015. (For more, see: This Company is as Unavoidable as it 
is Unloved.) 
Twenty-First Century Fox 
Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.'s (FOXA) Q2 operating income before depreciation and amortization increased 
12%. Fox studios enjoyed 24 Academy Award nominations in 2015, making it the industry leader. Twenty-First 
Century Fox also recently created the Europe's leading pay TV business. 
Google 
Google Inc. (GOOGL) is known as more of a technology company than a media company, but its YouTube 
segment consumes approximately 15% of all broadband traffic in the United States and Canada (only Netflix, 
Inc. (NFLX) is higher at 35%). Google also makes this list because of its $62.63 billion in cash, which means it 
can enter any business it pleases. If it chooses to expand its media presence, then it would likely steal share 
from some of the current industry leaders. (For related reading, see: How Google's Self-Driving Car Will 
Change Everything.) 
Speculative Media Stocks 
Charter Communications 
Q4 revenue jumped 9.9% at Charter Communications, Inc. (CHTR) thanks to higher customer penetration on 
Internet, video, and commercial businesses. Another positive is that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) recently 
increased its position in CHTR by adding 1.2 million shares. CHTR now represents 1.35% of the fund's 
portfolio. The reason CHTR is on the speculative list is a lack of profitability. 
Discovery Communications 
Differentiation is the key here thanks to Discovery Communications, Inc.'s (DISCA) success with docudramas. 
In FY2014, revenue increased 13%, adjusted earnings per diluted share improved 13%, free cash flow increased 
2%, and $1.4 billion worth of stock was repurchased. The biggest risks here are a challenging U.S. market and 
currency headwinds. It should also be pointed out that there is an 11% short position on the stock. (For related 
reading, see: A Breakdown of Stock Buybacks.) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024253 
Viacom 
MTV, VH1, CMT, BET, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr, Comedy Central, TV Land, SPIKE, and more. Do these sound 
like brands that are likely to suffer? No. Viacom, Inc. (VIA) is a profitable company that pays a small dividend. 
On the other hand, a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.88 isn't comforting. 
Time Warner 
Time Warner Inc. (TWX) has 165 channels across 200 countries. This includes HBO. In FY2014, revenue 
increased 3%. That's not spectacular, but adjusted EPS jumped 18%, which now represents six consecutive 
years of adjusted EPS growth in the high teens. Time Warner also returned $6.6 billion to shareholders via 
dividends and buybacks throughout the year. Over the long haul, cable companies will have a difficult time 
competing against streaming services, but all is okay for right now. 
Scripps Networks Interactive 
Among Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.'s (SNI) properties are Home and Garden Television, Food Network, 
Travel Channel, DIY Network, Cooking Channel and Great American Country. These are strong brands. Strong 
enough that Scripps Networks expects FY2015 revenue to increase approximately 4%. The company also 
expects selling, general, and administrative expenses to come in between flat and down 2%. Either way, it's a 
positive when revenue is outpacing SG&A expenses. Furthermore, Scripps Networks has announced that it's 
adding $1 billion to its share buyback program and increasing its dividend by 15%. The risk here is the stock's 
sensitivity to broader market corrections. (For a look back to 2009, see: Scripps Network Interactive Worth a  
Look.) 
Performance Comparisons 
Another reason why some stocks made the top list and others did not is performance. If a stock can't appreciate 
in a bull market, then how would you expect it to perform when the trend reverses? Capital preservation should 
be the number one priority for a savvy investor. Below are total return numbers for each company as of 
3/18/2015). 
1-Year 	3-Year 	5-Year 	10-Year 
DIS 	33.09% 	36.87% 	27.03% 	15.19% 
CBS 	-3.95% 	26.94% 	23.19% 	12.56% 
CMCSA 	19.26% 	27.62% 	23.13% 	13.40% 
FOXA 	6.46% 	26.99% 	24.13% 	8.83% 
GOOGL 	-6.61% 	21.87% 	14.84% 	20.18% 
CHTR 	50.27% 	143.56% 	140.36% 	n/a 
DISCA 	-25.98% 	8.93% 	13.74% 	n/a 
VIA 	-20.33% 	11.19% 	17.28% 	n/a 
TWX 	37.35% 	38.08% 	25.34% 	9.86% 
SNI 	10.10% 	15.26% 	12.24% 	n/a 
The Bottom Line 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024254 
The Top-Tier Media Stocks have outperformed Speculative Media Stocks over the past three years (for the most 
part). Therefore, you should strongly consider the first set of stocks listed above. While it's entirely possible 
they all underperform in 2015 if the market falters, these are elite names that are highly likely to be around for a 
long time. Even if the worst occurs, you will have an opportunity to add more to your position at cheaper prices.

FIRPTA and REIT Reform Provisions in 
New Tax Law Open Door to Increased 
Foreign Investment in U.S. Real

this Alert with your regular Sadis & 
Goldberg contact or with any of the 
partners whose names and contact 
information can be found at the end of 
the Alert. 
On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law a bill that significantly reforms the provisions 
of the Internal Revenue Code that were originally added 35 years ago by the Foreign Investment in 
Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA). The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the 
"PATH Act") also includes extensions of a number of tax relief provisions that expired at the end of 
2015. The PATH Act makes foreign capital investment in U.S. real estate, energy and infrastructure 
assets more attractive by expanding certain exemptions from FIRPTA and clarifying the application of 
certain FIRPTA provisions to REITs and their shareholders. 
I. FOREIGN PENSION FUNDS EXEMPTED FROM FIRPTA TAXATION 
One of the most significant provisions of the PATH Act is the addition of a complete exemption from 
FIRPTA for "qualified foreign pension funds" and "entities" wholly owned by such funds, effective on 
the date of enactment. A foreign pension fund is "qualified" if it is subject to government regulation 
and certain reporting requirements in its home jurisdiction, is established to provide retirement or 
pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees, has no greater 
than 5 percent beneficiaries, and enjoys tax benefits on either contributions or investment income in 
its home jurisdiction. The new exemption applies to direct investments and investments made 
through partnerships (including private equity funds). The PATH Act provides for certain details to be 
addressed by Treasury Regulations. It appears that the "entities" eligible for the FIRPTA exemption 
could include a U.S. or foreign "blocker" corporation that is wholly owned by a qualifying foreign 
pension fund. This exemption will, for the first time, permit foreign pension funds, including some 
governmental funds, to hold control positions in REITs without losing their FIRPTA exemption. 
Note that the regular rules of the Internal Revenue Code other than FIRPTA still would apply to the 
foreign pension fund. Therefore, a foreign pension fund that invested in a partnership that was 
engaged in a U.S. business (real estate or non-real estate) would still be subject to U.S. federal income 
tax on its share of the partnership's "effectively connected" U.S. business income in the same manner 
as other non-U.S. persons making an investment in a U.S. business partnership. 
Here are some examples of what can be done in light of the changes made by the PATH Act: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026830 
A. Raw Land Investment. A qualifying foreign pension fund invests in a partnership that buys raw land 
in the United States. (This could be a vacant lot, timberland, oil and gas or mineral property, or other 
property interests that qualify for treatment as real property for federal income tax purposes.) The 
investment is a capital asset, as the partnership is not engaged in business. The partnership later sells 
the property to a developer, or the pension fund sells its partnership interest. Under prior law, the 
foreign pension fund's non-business capital gain would automatically be subject to US federal income 
tax because of FIRPTA. Under the new law, the foreign pension fund's long-term or short-term capital 
gain is exempt from U.S. income tax and FIRPTA withholding because FIRPTA does not apply. 
B. Equity Kicker Mortgage Loan Investment. A foreign pension fund acquires an ownership interest 
in a mortgage loan secured by U.S. real property. The loan includes stated interest plus an equity 
kicker (e.g., additional interest equal to a share of gain realized on sale of the property). Such an 
equity kicker loan is treated as a U.S. real property interest under FIRPTA. Under prior law, gain 
realized by the foreign pension fund upon sale of the loan would automatically be subject to U.S. 
income tax under FIRPTA. Under new law, the gain realized on the sale of the mortgage loan would 
be exempt from U.S. income tax. (This conclusion is based on the assumption that the foreign pension 
fund is a mere investor and not engaged in an active lending business in the U.S.) 
C. U.S. Blocker Corp. Investment. A foreign pension fund wants to make an equity investment in a 
U.S. real estate business that is organized as a partnership. The foreign pension fund forms a U.S. 
corporation to acquire the partnership interest and the corporation is capitalized with a mix of equity 
and debt held by the shareholder. The corporation is subject to U.S. income tax on its net income, but 
gets to deduct interest paid or accrued on the debt held by the shareholder. The foreign corporation 
later sells the stock of the corporation. Under prior law, the gain on sale of the stock would be subject 
to U.S. income tax because the corporation was a "U.S. real property holding corporation" under 
FIRPTA. Under new law, FIRPTA does not apply to the foreign pension fund, so the capital gain on sale 
of the stock is exempt from U.S. income tax. Note that the U.S.-source interest paid to the foreign 
shareholder could be subject to U.S. withholding tax under the regular rules of the Code, but if the 
pension fund is organized in a jurisdiction that has a tax treaty with the U.S. (e.g., UK, Germany, 
France, China, Japan, etc.), these interest payments could be exempt from U.S. withholding under such 
tax treaty. 
2. FIRPTA EXEMPTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED REIT STOCK INCREASED FROM 5 
PERCENT to 10 PERCENT 
For publicly traded REITs, the PATH Act opens the door to increased investment by expanding the 
current statutory exemption from FIRPTA for small portfolio investments by non-U.S. persons. The Act 
provides all foreign investors (not just pension funds) can now own up to 10 percent of the stock of a 
publicly traded REIT without triggering FIRPTA tax. Under prior law, FIRPTA tax would apply upon the 
foreign investor's sale of stock of the publicly traded REIT or the receipt of certain distributions from 
such REIT if the foreign investor holds more than 5 percent of the REIT's stock. 
3. CLARIFICATION OF THE EXEMPTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN DOMESTICALLY CONTROLLED REITS 
The PATH Act includes important clarifying presumptions that will allow publicly traded REITs and their 
shareholders to rely with greater confidence on the current law FIRPTA exemption for gains realized 
on sales of stock in "domestically controlled" REITS. In determining whether a REIT is domestically 
controlled, the REIT is now permitted to presume that any owner of less than 5 percent of any publicly 
traded shares of the REIT is a U.S. person, unless the REIT has actual knowledge to the contrary. 
4. REVENUE RAISING PROVISIONS RELATING TO FIRPTA AND REITs 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026831 
The PATH Act includes certain revenue raising provisions to offset, in part, the tax revenue loss 
anticipated to result of the above-described tax reform provisions of the Act. Such revenue raisers 
include (among other technical changes) the following provisions: 
A. Increase in FIRPTA Withholding Rate. The purchaser of a U.S. real property interest from a non-
U.S. person was previously required to withhold 10 percent of the purchase price under FIRPTA. The 
PATH Act increases this rate to 15 percent for dispositions occurring after the 60th day following 
enactment, but maintains the 10 percent rate for sales of residential property for between $300,000 
and $1,000,000. This provision is not a tax increase but is designed to ensure that FIRPTA withholding 
collects a sufficient portion of the taxes owed. 
B. Restriction on REIT Spin-offs. In recent years, it has become increasingly common for large 
corporate taxpayers to reduce their tax bills by contributing real estate used in their businesses to a 
subsidiary, spinning off the subsidiary in a tax free transaction under Code section 355, and then 
having the spun-out corporation making a REIT election. The PATH Act curtails such activity by (i) 
providing that neither the distributing corporation nor the spun-out corporation can make a REIT 
election for ten years after that corporation was involved in a Section 355 transaction and (ii) denying 
tax-free treatment to spin-offs in which the distributing corporation or spun-out corporation (but not 
both) is a REIT. 
5. CONCLUSION 
The revisions to the FIRPTA and REIT rules discussed above represent a potentially large expansion of 
the incentives for foreign investment in U.S. real property interests, especially for foreign pension 
funds. Sponsors of U.S. real property investment funds and foreign investors with interests in U.S. real 
estate assets should review the new provisions to determine whether such persons could benefit from 
such U.S. tax law changes.

The taxes are ready to go according to RJ and Tom. There were two changes made last friday: $4mm of RA and 
Artspace losses can/shld reduce the 3.8% medicare tax and $7mm of TRA payments shld also be exempt from 
medicare taxes (consistent with prior year APO and Akin Gump advice). In aggregate this increases our 
overpayment by $400k. 
Pls call me and I'll find rich and tom if you want to discuss. Thx, b 
Otherwise, taxes are complete and we are ready to press the button and file electronically. B

From: richard kahn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
not sure your thoughts on likelihood of his plan (with very little details) passing 
my concern and thoughts are that if itemized deductions are capped at 200,000 you will be impacted by Trump 
plan 
your itemized deductions on the last 2 years returns were as follows: 
2015 1,721,474 
2014 739,139 
the two biggest items on your itemized are RE Taxes of approximately 600,000 per year and investment interest 
expense from STC K-1 with the majority coming from boothbay 
i thought that 2016 may be a good year to contribute appreciated stock to gratitude or enhanced for three 
reasons: 
a) potential cap on itemized per trump 
b) very low EDC income this year so your effective tax rate is higher 
c) if itemized stays however tax rates go down charitable deduction is worth more in 2016 
Gratitude & Enhanced Summary 
Cash 4,738,854 
Equities 3,792,177 
Fixed Income 2,199,792  
Total Value as of 10-31-2016 10,730,823 
Although calculation below does not factor in growth i ran summaries how long foundations can continue to 
make annual contributions at the following levels: 
600,000 17.88 years 
700,000 15.33 years 
800,000 13.41 years 
900,000 11.92 years 
1,000,000 10.73 years

Rich, following up on your question from a while back about this topic. Please find a white paper attached. 
Regards, 
Amanda 
The election of Donald Trump as President is expected to lead to significant tax law changes. The tax changes may come 
in two parts: from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and its related taxes and from comprehensive tax 
reform. Since Republicans will also have majorities in both the House and Senate, such changes could be undertaken 
without bipartisan support. Although it is not yet known exactly what the changes will be or when they would be 
effective, we are issuing this Tax Alert to inform you of changes that are anticipated, based on proposals made during 
the campaign by both President-elect Trump and the House Republicans. We also discuss how these changes may 
impact your planning, both currently and in the future.

Private equity has direct line to new administration 
Jan. 19, 2017 12:05 PM ET1By: Stephen Alpher, SA News Editor 
There's not just Wilbur Ross who will serve as Commerce Secretary, but also Blackstone (NYSE:BX) CEO 
Steve Schwarzman who will chair the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, and attorney Jay Clayton - who 
has advised on numerous major P-E deals - to lead the SEC. 
Aside from those official posts, the president-elect has met with the heads of Carlyle Group (NASDAQ:CG) 
and KKR since his election. 
"There seems to be more interest in the advice of real-world practitioners than in the past," says the head of the 
P-E industry's D.C. lobbying group. "This is encouraging." 
Indeed. Among P-E's top priorities is carried interest - one of the few things Trump and Clinton agreed on 
during the campaign. Carried interest is currently taxed at 23.8% vs. the top ordinary income tax rate of 39.6%. 
Like Clinton, Trump wanted carried interest taxed as ordinary income, though Trump would lower the top rate 
to 33%. Other tax law changes Trump is proposing could cut the effective tax rate further - perhaps to as low as 
25%, or just marginally higher than currently. 
Another big priority is retaining the tax deductibility of interest. Trump wants to give companies the ability to 
either keep that deduction or pass and gain the ability to immediately expense capital investment. A plan by 
House Republicans might not be as favorable.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026663 
REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE ALERT 
FEBRUARY 15, 2017 
TIC Form SHC Deadline Approaching - Form Deadline is 
March 3, 2017 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury recently released a revised Form SHC. Form SHC, which is part of 
the Treasury International Capital ("TIC") data reporting system, is the mandatory five-year benchmark 
survey of the ownership of foreign securities by U.S. residents. Absent an announcement of a delay 
from the Trump administration, the report is due to the Federal Reserve Board of NY ("FRBNY") by March 
3, 2017 for data reportable as of December 31, 2016. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026664 
All U.S. resident custodians and end-investors with holdings of foreign portfolio securities above the 
reporting thresholds must report. In addition, all U.S.-resident custodians and end-investors that are 
notified by the FRBNY are required to file a report. 
The reporting threshold for Schedule 2 is $200 million in total fair value of all foreign securities owned 
by the SHC Reporter and not held with a U.S.-resident custodian. The reporting threshold for Schedule 
3 is $200 million in total fair value of foreign securities held with any one unaffiliated U.S.-resident 
custodian that is not a central securities depository. 
Custodians are all organizations that hold securities in safekeeping for other organizations. Most U.S.-
resident custodians also invest in foreign securities for their own account. U.S.-resident custodians 
should report both the foreign portfolio securities held in safekeeping for other U.S. residents and their 
own foreign portfolio securities. 
End-investors are U.S.-resident organizations that invest in foreign securities for their own portfolios or 
invest on behalf of others, such as investment managers/fund sponsors. This includes securities that are 
held-for-trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. U.S.-resident end-investors include, but are not 
limited to: 
• Financial and non-financial organizations 
• Managers of private and public pension funds 
• Managers/sponsors of funds, country funds, unit-investment funds, exchange-traded funds, 
collective-investment trusts, hedge funds or any other similarly pooled, commingled funds. Also 
managers/sponsors of private equity companies, venture capital companies, hedge funds and other 
private investment vehicles 
• Insurance companies

David Woo just sent this — please let me know if you'd like an update on his Washington/market views 
More sign that VAT is making its way into the discussion.... 
As you all know, I have been arguing that VAT make tremendous economic sense 
A VAT has all the virtues of a BAT without any of its drawbacks 
The fact that this is being discussed makes me think that we are getting to a more serious stage of the negotiation over 
tax reform 
This news is bullish for Trump trades, at least for the medium-term 
White House explores two new tax ideas — a value-added tax and carbon tax — as leading proposal to raise revenue 
falters 
Washington Post 
April 4 
By Damian Paletta and Max Ehrenfreund 
President Trump's administration is exploring the creation of two controversial new taxes — a value-added tax and a 
carbon tax — as part of a broad overhaul of the tax code, according to an administration official and one other person 
briefed on the process. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 014857 
The value-added tax, which is popular in many other countries, would serve as a kind of national sales tax, one that 
consumers would pay when they make purchases and that businesses would pay for supplies, services and raw 
materials. A carbon tax would target the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouses gases in the burning of 
gasoline, coal and other fossil fuels. 
The study of the new options — which would represent major changes to American economic policy — comes as the 
administration looks to tax reform as its next major battleground for implementing its agenda. Trump wants to cut 
taxes sharply, but his advisers are looking for ways to raise revenue so as not to create a giant hole in the deficit. 
Administration officials stressed that no final decision has been made and they are reviewing different alternatives. 
Two officials and a third person confirmed the consideration of the value-added tax, while one official and the third 
person confirmed the consideration of the carbon tax. 
The search for new options reflects a recognition of the political challenges facing a proposal known as a border-
adjustment tax that the White House and some Republicans had begun to rally around. The proposal, effectively a tax 
on imports, would not only raise needed revenue but also serve to fulfill Trump's pledge to protect American 
companies from unfair export competition. 
The tax would create incentives for companies to manufacture and produce goods domestically. But the proposal is 
unpopular with many other Republicans, who have said it would raise costs for consumers on things such as 
automobiles, electronics and clothing. 
A value-added tax and a carbon tax have long been favored tools among economists, including some on the right, to 
raise revenue in a way that supports economic growth. But the prospect of any new taxes has long drawn skepticism 
from Republicans.

Please advice how best to proceed.

Hello Jeffrey —

I hope all is well with you. As per Peggy Siegal's office, I have included here the invitation to the IFP Gotham Awards 
ceremony, which will be held on Monday, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. 
This year's ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn't be more thrilled with this year's impressive 
group of Tributees. The Actress Tribute will go to Nicole Kidman and the Actor Tribute to Dustin Hoffman. The Director 
Tribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the Industry 
Tribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn't be more pleased 
to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year's special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year ranging 
from Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Blige, this year's 
ceremony looks to be the most star studded ever. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029433 
Estate Planning After the Enactment of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act 
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the "Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act" into law. The new legislation represents a compromise between 
House and Senate Republicans on their respective tax overhaul 
proposals, and is the most significant tax reform legislation to be 
enacted in over thirty years. Although the inherent complexities of the 
new legislation, combined with the whirlwind pace of its passage, poses 
many questions for analysts and tax practitioners alike as they begin to 
navigate the new tax system, we do have an understanding of what the 
new law will mean for high net worth individuals interested in advancing 
their estate planning goals. 
Most of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") became 
effective on January 1st, and will sunset (or default to prior law) after 
December 31, 2025, absent further congressional action. In addition to 
extensive income tax related changes, including modifications to the 
individual and corporate income tax rates, doubling of the standard 
income tax deduction, capping of the state and local tax deduction, 
elimination of the personal income tax exemption, increase in the 
exemption for the alternative minimum tax, and decrease in the 
mortgage interest deduction, the Act temporarily doubles the federal 
estate, generation-skipping transfer ("GST") and gift tax exemption 
amounts, thereby offering high net worth families enhanced planning 
opportunities.

The 2017 Tax Reform Act - Key 
Provisions Impacting Fund Managers

partners whose names and contact 
information can be found at the end of 
the Alert. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), which was signed into law by President Trump on December 
22, 2017, contains the most sweeping federal tax law changes since 1986. Most provisions of the Tax 
Act take effect for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. This Client Alert is not intended 
to be a comprehensive review of this massive legislation. The Alert focuses on certain provisions of 
the Tax Act that may have the most significant impact on asset management firms, their owners, their 
investment vehicles, and the investors in such funds. Certain changes made by the Tax Act are 
permanent but many others are scheduled to expire after 2025 unless extended by further 
Congressional legislation. 
I. Carried Interest Survives in Modified Form 
The Tax Act contains changes to the treatment of "carried interests", but such changes are not as 
negative as the prior legislative changes that had been proposed but never adopted. The granting of a 
"future profits only" interest in a partnership in connection with the performances of services to the 
partnership continues to be eligible for tax-free treatment under the new law. For certain owners of 
"Applicable Partnership Interests" (of the sort that would generally be issued by an investment 
partnership to the general partner), the Act applies a three-year holding period requirement for capital 
gains derived by the partnership (or from the disposition of the profits interest) to be eligible for the 
long-term capital gains tax rate (instead of the generally applicable one-year holding threshold). 
The change in carried interest taxation clearly impacts managers of hedge funds more than managers 
of private equity funds or real estate funds, which typically have a longer than three-year holding period 
for investments in their portfolio companies or real estate assets. The new tax treatment applies to 
income realized in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and existing carried interests are not 
grandfathered. Thus, it appears that any unrealized capital gains which have already been allocated to 
a general partner on the books of the partnership would be subject to the new tax treatment at the time 
the partnership realizes such gains in 2018 or subsequent years. 
Note, however, that the Tax Act does not change the current federal income tax treatment of carried 
interest allocations of "qualified dividends" to individuals, which are also taxed at long-term capital gains 
rates. The capital gains from the carried interest that fail to satisfy the new three-year holding period 
requirement are treated as "short-term capital gains" which are taxable at ordinary income rates. 
The "Applicable Partnership Interest" held by the general partner or an affiliate should not include any 
portion of the partnership interest that is attributable to capital contributed to the partnership by the 
general partner. The exact manner on how such exception will apply will need to be addressed in future 
IRS notices or regulations to be issued. Limited partners holding capital interests in private investment 
funds are also not affected and therefore retain the one-year holding period requirement for long-term 
capital gain treatment. 
Note also that the term "Applicable Partnership Interest" does not include an interest held directly or 
indirectly by a corporation and it currently appears that such exception includes holdings by both C 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026779 
corporations and S corporations. It is likely that further guidance will be issued on this question, as it 
may be advantageous for certain general partners to convert their existing entities that hold the carried 
interest to S corporations, and such general partners may have until March 15, 2018 to accomplish such 
conversion. 
Managers of hedge funds and other partnerships that do not hold capital assets for more than three 
years before their sale may consider whether the carried interest incentive allocation should be replaced 
with an incentive fee structure. Also, the reduced after-tax value of a carried interest partnership 
allocation may impact the management company's executive compensation arrangements. 
Although an earlier version of the tax legislation would have repealed the exemption in the Code which 
provides that a limited partner's income is exempt from self-employment tax, the final version of the 
Tax Act does not contain such change in law. 
II. New 21% Corporate Income Tax Rate and Reduction of the Maximum Rates Applicable to 
Individuals 
The Tax Act reduces the 35 percent corporate rate to a flat 21 percent corporate rate. There is no special 
higher rate for personal service corporations (as existed under prior law). The new 21 percent rate is 
effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The corporate alternative tax (AMT) 
has also been repealed. Such corporate tax changes are permanent. In contrast, the highest applicable 
federal income tax rate for individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers is reduced from 39.6% to 
37%. In addition, the 3.8% "add-on" Medicare contributions tax on an individual's net investment 
income remains in effect. 
1. Possible Use of a "C" Corporation as a Tax Shelter 
Since the new 21% corporate tax rate is now well below the highest rate applicable to high income 
individuals, some investment managers may conclude that some or all of their management entities 
that are pass through partnerships should convert to corporate form. In addition, certain partnership 
funds that are engaged in trade or business, such as active loan origination or real estate activities may 
find it advantageous to convert to corporate form. 
The advantage to the corporate form of organization is that the C corporation's net income after taxes 
is not taxable to its shareholders until it is distributed (e.g., either as a dividend or as a redemption of 
stock (i.e., as a capital gain)). Corporations that are engaged in active businesses are able to retain and 
reinvest their earnings. Also relevant to choice of entity decisions is the fact that the Tax Act restricts 
the ability of individuals to deduct more than $10,000 in state and local taxes, but corporations can 
continue to deduct such taxes as under prior law. 
However, there are certain anti-abuse provisions that remain in the Internal Revenue Code that limit 
the use of a C corporation as a tax shelter. Lurking in the Code is a provision which allows the Internal 
Revenue Service to impose a 20 percent additional "accumulated earnings" income tax on the 
"accumulated taxable income" of a corporation if such taxable income is allowed to accumulate "beyond 
the "reasonable needs of the business". There is a $250,000 safe harbor for most corporations, while 
personal service corporations are allowed a safe harbor of only $150,000. There is also a 20 percent tax 
on the "personal holding company income" (i.e., passive investment income) of certain closely held C 
corporations (i.e., when five or fewer individuals own, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of the 
corporation's stock and at least 60 percent of the corporation's adjusted ordinary income is personal 
holding company income (e.g., passive investment income)). These penalty taxes on corporations have 
received little attention in recent decades. However, with the enactment of the sharply lower corporate 
tax rate, these anti-abuse rules are likely to become a significant focus of the IRS in its audits of tax 
returns of privately held corporations. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026780 
2. The New Deduction for Qualified Business Income of Pass Through Entities 
Congress also wanted to provide an income tax rate reduction for those businesses that are organized 
as partnerships or S corporations or which are owned by sole proprietors. In order to meet this goal, the 
Tax Act provides an income tax deduction for individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers equal to (i) 
20 percent of their domestic "qualified business income"; plus (ii) 20 percent of any qualifying dividends 
from real estate investment trusts, qualifying income from publicly traded partnerships, and gain 
derived from sale of such publicly traded partnerships that would be treated as ordinary 
income. Therefore, such deduction results in an effective federal income tax rate of 29.6% on such 
qualifying income for a top bracket individual. The deduction does not apply to investment income (i.e., 
capital gains, dividends (other than certain ordinary income dividends paid by REITs), and most interest 
income). In addition, it does not apply to reasonable compensation income and guaranteed payments 
paid to the taxpayer from the business. 
The 20 percent of "qualified business income" deduction described in (i) above is also generally limited 
to the greater of either (a) 50% of the W-2 wages paid with respect to the qualified trade or business, 
or (b) the sum of 25% of the W-2 wages paid with respect to such business plus 2.5% of the unadjusted 
tax basis of all qualified business property of such business. Thus, if the partnership, S corporation or 
sole proprietorship does not pay "W-2 wages" and the second limitation is a minor amount or not 
applicable, the owner or pass through taxpayer's tax deduction would be a minor amount or zero. 
Unfortunately, partners or owners of certain types of professional service businesses, including 
financial services providers, investment managers, brokers, consultants, lawyers and accountants (and 
others), are not permitted to claim the "qualified business income" deduction unless the taxpayer's 
adjusted gross income is below certain levels ($207,500 for individuals and $365,000 for married couples 
filing jointly). Even in such case, the benefit of the available deduction is phased out ratably as the 
taxpayer's income exceeds $157,500 if single, or $315,000 if filing a joint tax return. Therefore, fund 
managers organized as pass through entities are not likely to, and investment funds organized as 
partnerships will not, derive a significant benefit from this deduction. 
ISSUES FOR PARTNERSHIP FUNDS 
1. Repeal of Itemized Deductions Previously Available to Non-Corporate Taxpayers for Non-Business 
Investment Expenses 
For 2018 through 2025, the Tax Act completely repeals the deductions previously allowed to individuals 
and other non-corporate taxpayers for "miscellaneous itemized deductions" (which were subject to a 
2% floor and a phase-out rule under prior law). It is important to note that for individual investors in 
partnership funds that are not treated as engaged in a trade or business, the investor's share of the 
fund's investment expenses, including management fees, would now pass through as non-deductible 
miscellaneous itemized deductions. If the fund is properly classified as an active "trader" rather than a 
mere investor, then such expenses would be completely deductible as trade or business expenses. This 
Tax Act change obviously puts considerable strain on the fund manager and its tax advisors with respect 
to the trader vs. investor issue. At this time, there is a lack of clear guidance from the Internal Revenue 
Service on what level of trading activity is sufficient for a professionally managed fund to qualify as a 
"trader fund". 
In cases where a partnership fund's expected activities are not likely to qualify for trader status or 
another trade or business, the fund's sponsor may find that US high net worth individuals may now 
prefer to invest in the offshore corporate feeder fund instead of the onshore partnership fund. The US 
income tax reason for this would be that since the offshore feeder is classified as a corporation for US 
tax purposes, its net income would be calculated under the rules applicable to corporations, for which 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026781 
there are no miscellaneous itemized deductions. Thus, assuming that the foreign feeder is a passive 
foreign investment company (PFIC), if the US high net worth shareholder is able to make the "qualified 
electing fund" election, the net income the investor would be required to report on his federal income 
tax return would be calculated after deducting all of the corporation's expenses, including management 
fees and investment expenses. 
2. Non-US Partner's Gain on Sale of Partnership Interest may be Taxable as US Trade or Business 
Income; New Withholding Requirements apply to the Purchaser or the Fund 
The Tax Act specifically provides that gains realized by a non-US partner on a sale or exchange of a 
partnership interest will be treated as effectively connected US trade or business income ("Ed") to the 
extent that such partner would have been allocated [Cl had the partnership sold all of its assets. This 
provision is consistent with the IRS position in Revenue Ruling 91-32, and overrules a recent Tax Court 
case which had rejected the position taken in such IRS Ruling and instead held that since a partnership 
interest is treated as a capital asset, the foreign person's gain on its sale could escape US income taxation 
as a non-business capital gain. 
To the extent that a partnership has any [Cl-generating assets (including US real property interests), a 
seller of a partnership interest will have to provide a certificate that it is not a foreign person, and in the 
absence of such a certificate a purchaser (which could include the fund) will be required to withhold 
10% of the gross purchase price. Further, the Tax Act provides that if the purchaser does not withhold, 
the partnership is required to withhold on distributions to such purchaser to cover the withholding. The 
Tax Act provides that the new withholding obligation for purchasers is effective for sales or other 
dispositions of partnership interests after December 31, 2017. 
3. New Limitation on Deduction of Net Interest Expense 
Under prior law, subject to some restrictions and limitations, business interest paid or accrued by a 
business was fully deductible. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act limits 
the deduction for "net business interest" expense for every type of business, regardless of entity form, 
to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income. Business interest paid or accrued after the effective date on 
indebtedness, including debt that was incurred prior to the effective date of the Tax Act, is subject to 
this limitation. 
The term business interest does not include investment interest described in Code section 
163(d). Operating companies, such as management entities, and investment funds that are engaged in 
a business and have outstanding indebtedness could be subject to such deduction limitation. For this 
purpose, "adjusted taxable income" is determined at the entity level for partnerships, and is similar to 
EBITDA (i.e., net earnings before deducting interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for 
taxable years 2018 through 2021. A more restrictive 20% of [BIT limitation (net earnings before 
deducting interest expense and taxes) applies for 2022 and later years. 
Certain taxpayers are exempted for the new interest deductibility limitation, including small businesses 
with average annual gross receipts of $25 million or less for the three prior taxable years, as well as real 
estate businesses that elect out of such limitation. The Conference Committee Report on the Tax Act 
clarified that interest paid on shareholder loans by a blocker corporation is "business interest" that is 
subject to this new limitation. Blocker corporations for a lending business would have business interest 
income, which reduces the effect of this new limitation on net business interest expense (i.e., deductible 
business interest expense in excess of business interest income). 
4. Deemed Repatriation Tax 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026782 
One of the major tax raising provisions in the Tax Act is a one-time tax imposed on the accumulated 
earnings held in foreign subsidiaries of US companies. This provision is broader that it may first 
appear. Under the Tax Act, any 10% US shareholder of a foreign corporation (determined on December 
31, 2017) will be required to include in income, for the taxable year 2017, its proportionate share of the 
foreign corporation's undistributed earnings, if the foreign corporation is either a controlled foreign 
corporation (CFC) or has at least one 10% US shareholder that is a corporation. 
This law change could generate significant phantom income with respect to 10%-or-greater owned 
foreign portfolio companies both (i) for US taxable investors (including the general partner and its 
owners) in partnership funds organized in the United States and/or for US sponsors of non-US 
funds. The Tax Act provides for reduced tax rates on such income for corporate investors of 8% (for 
earnings invested in tangible business assets) and 15.5% (for cash and cash equivalents), and 9.05% and 
17.54% for investors taxed as individuals. 
5. Tax-Free Section 1031 Like Kind Exchanges Eliminated Except for Real Property Transactions 
The Tax Act eliminates the ability to qualify for tax-free exchange treatment under Code section 1031 if 
the property being exchanged is personal property. Consequently, for transactions occurring after 
December 31, 2017, exchanges of artwork, equipment, vehicles or other personal property held for 
investment or for use in a business, including Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, for like kind property 
will not eligible for Section 1031 tax treatment. Exchanges of real property continue to be eligible for 
Section 1031 exchange treatment. 
6. Certain Tax Accounting Rules Have Been Revised 
Under prior law, net operating losses (NOLs) could be carried back two years and carried forward for 
twenty years. Under the Tax Act, NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 generally 
cannot be carried back, but can be carried forward indefinitely. However, only 80% of a company's 
taxable income is permitted to be offset by NOLs. The remainder of the unused NOLs will carry forward. 
The Tax Act also expands the category of corporations and partnerships that are eligible to use the cash 
method of accounting. Certain businesses may derive a tax benefit by switching from the accrual 
method to the cash method of accounting. 
7. Deferred Compensation 
The Tax Act generally leaves the current tax rules for deferred compensation intact. However, the Act 
also includes a new deferral provision for certain types of broad-based employee equity, which may 
apply to certain private companies. 
8. Estate and Gift Tax Changes 
In 2017, an individual could give or transfer at death up to $5,490,000 without paying gift or estate taxes. 
The Tax Act doubles the federal estate and gift tax unified exemption amount for estates of decedents 
dying and gifts made after December 31, 2017, and inflation adjustments will continue to 
apply. Therefore, in 2018, an individual has approximately an $11.2 million exemption, and a married 
couple has approximately $22.4 million of available shelter from federal gift and estate taxation. Note 
that the large exemption which applies to gifts may be useful in federal income tax planning. For 
example, large lifetime gifts of appreciated securities, artwork and other personal property (including 
possibly, a carried interest) to relatives who are in lower income tax brackets, or who reside in states 
with lower, or no state income taxes could save the family substantial federal income and/or state 
income taxes when such property is sold by the recipient of the gift.

Hi Jeff, 
I realize the last term sheet was a draft, my fault (my computer sync'd the draft with the same name). 
Here is a correct version, the last page is the signature page. It would be great if I could get this back 
tomorrow. Nothing is due until the recap is complete, hopefully in about 4 weeks. I am planning to start those 
discussions the end of next week. 
Things are going well. The more I learn the more excited I get. I will be at Tarana tomorrow 
discussing a window mount version to try to get to self-install. lgbps in a self-install package would be the last 
step. 
We will only need a tower ever 4-5km in the city, which is basically 2 or 3 rooftops for all of Boston. 
I met with American Tower today (I know their CEO and CTO) and they have plenty of room on the John 
Hancock. 
Fun Stuff and great to be doing something together!

Saudi trade continues to gain momentum as we head into March 28 FTSE decision, followed by MSCI in June. 
Our base case is for a positive outcome for both EM index reviews. 
• Tadawul +5% past 3 sessions printing new 3 year highs, Foreign inflows YTD at $1.35bn 
• Recent headline on Aramco: Saudi Aramco likely to be delayed to 2019. Delay not all together surprising giving complexity of the transaction, delays in choosing 
the trading venues, as well as to better align the IPO with potential MSCI / FTSE index inflow timelines 
• Crown Prince MBS will appear on '60 Minutes' on March 18th, one day before he lands in the US for a 10 day tour, meeting Trump on the 20th. 
• Reform agenda picking up speed: Women Driving; Entertainment/Movie Theaters; Welfare Programs; Market access reforms & Intl debt issues 
Saudi Fundamentals are strong (see Jean-Michel Saliba's report from Jan. 29th below): 
• Growth has bottomed out 
• OPEC is succeeding at rebalancing the oil market. Fiscal adjustment now sufficient to safeguard stability at cUS$60/bbl. 
• Equity strategy: remain positive, outlook gains momentum - We retain our positive view on the Saudi market as we see strong earnings 
momentum as well as increasing appetite for Saudi equities amongst global investors: 
Best way to access the trade: IX/MAP (MSCI Saudi Provisional Index) 
• 32-name MSCI-owned index, that will rebalance into the full MSCI EM index upon inclusion 
• Trades $90m/ day based on bottleneck liquidity 
• Tradable on swap at lmL+90bps, std comm applies; also accessible on fully funded Luxembourg-listed warrant (MERRI1DT LX) 
10 single stock names to own in Saudi 
• Al Rajhi: BAML Top pick for 2018 » Largest bank in Saudi » Reflation trade beneficiary » We see the bank continuing to deliver strong earnings momentum on 
the back of: (1) Stand out NIM expansion given a unique cost of funding position and further policy rate hikes (2) a continued normalization in asset quality 
driving CoR lower; (3) Higher loan growth than peers as it benefits from consumer loan growth (particularly housing) whilst taking share in the corporate market and 
(4) Al Rajhi is set to be a key beneficiary from the potential forthcoming Saudi index inclusions. 
• NCB: We see NCB as a key beneficiary from the economic diversification program the Government has introduced. Its large balance sheet and resulting ability to 
finance mega projects should allow it to capture market share in the coming years. Further support will come from having the PIF as a major shareholder. We also see 
a sublime margin outlook given NCB's ability to benefit from rising interest rates and bond yields. 
• SABIC: Expect strong earnings momentum in FY18E driven by robust product prices as well as solid plant operations. View company's intent to expand 
internationally as a catalyst for unlocking balance sheet value. The company is expected to be the largest constituent of Saudi MSCI EM Index (-16%). Shares trade at a 
2018E EV/EBITDA of 7.4x, —20% discount vs global peers. 
• Yansab: Given robust MEG pricing outlook (40% of profits, prices up 18% YTD) providing a healthy tailwind to earnings this year, we expect an attractive dividend 
yield of 6% (top quartile globally) in FY18E/19E well supported by FCF yields of 9% and a net cash position. 
• SIC: One of the main beneficiaries of index inflows into Saudi. STC has finally improved management representation to investors with the departure of the 
previous IR, and new team in place. Significant government receivables recovery to drive stock price for next two quarters, while Careem stake can provide some 
positive headline risk on valuations. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029459 
• Jarir: We like Jarir for its potential to increase its market penetration having increased its store count by 13% since August 2017 while maintaining its premium 
ROE of 53% and attractive dividend. 
• Al Tayyar : Stock will see a slew of positive catalysts over the next two quarters, particularly a second tranche of substantial gov receivable recoveries in Ql. 
130mn SAR loss from associates in 2017 is a one off and should make comps easier this year. Q1 earnings should see the first earnings growth after a very difficult 2 
years. Makkah real estate REIT will also provide an uplift. 
• Al Hokair: has massively under performed in Saudi index and consumer sector and should see substantial improvement in business in 2018 as LFL turns the 
corner and the company businesses a beneficiary from social reforms in the country. Debt restructuring concerns likely behind us at this point, relief there would be 
the main catalyst for the name. 
• Malath / Alrajhi Takaful: 2 of the top motor insurers in Saudi secular growth trend in motor insurance sector over the next two years as the regulator clamps 
down on more than 50% uninsured drivers while women driving to present multiyear volume growth story.

GEMs Paper #31 
Saudi Arabia: growth bull, fiscal bear 
29 January 2018 
Key takeaways 
• Growth recovers as high oil prices allow looser fiscal, contain near-term deterioration. Mega-projects offer upside potential 
HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029460 
• The oil price at which reforms now bring imbalances to low mid-single digit levels moves to US$60/bbl, from US$50/bbl before. 
• Earnings momentum, index events make us positive Saudi stocks. Prefer banks, petchems. Top picks: Rajhi, Samba, Yansab, Sabic 
Macro: sweet spot for now 
Economic activity has bottomed out as high oil prices are allowing implementation of looser fiscal policy and containing near-term fiscal 
deterioration. The government intends to support activity through a) a more gradual pace of fiscal reforms; b) introduction of Household/Cost of 
Living Allowances and Private Sector Support programs; c) introduction of structural reforms; and, d) the launch of mega-projects. The latter 
provides most upside potential to our average growth projections of 2.2-2.5(Yoyoy. 
Fiscal reforms now need US$60/bbl to safeguard stability 
The oil price threshold at which the macroeconomic adjustment brings imbalances to low mid-single digit levels moves to cUS$60/bbl, from our 
previous assessmcni of cUS$50/bbl. The revised Fiscal Balance program exposes the budget to volatility in oil prices. Still, there are four ways in 
which authorities can improve on fiscal dynamics: 1) front-loaded energy pricing reform; 2) privatizations; 3) proceeds from anti-corruption 
crackdown; and, 4) phasing out of the Royal Order next year. 
Equity strategy: remain positive, outlook gains momentum 
We retain our positive view on the Saudi market as we see strong earnings momentum as well as increasing appetite for Saudi equities amongst 
global investors. Our views are based on: (1) attractive valuation, with the Saudi market now trading at a mere 3% premium to GEMs versus a 
historic premium of more than 30%; (2) improving macro fundamentals; (3) the prospect for accelerating earnings, FCF and dividend growth on the 
back of reform programs, an expansionary budget and a more pedestrian pace of austerity implementation; and, (4) the potential twin index 
inclusion events in 2018. 
Prefer banks and petchems 
Within the Saudi market, our preference lies with companies offering strong earnings and FCF momentum, attractive valuations and dividend 
yields. In this regard, our sector preference is tilted towards the banks and petchems, who we see as key beneficiaries from the 2018 budget and 
revised fiscal balance program. We highlight Al Rajhi & Samba as our top picks amongst the banks, Yansab & SABIC amongst the petchems. 
Elsewhere, given the inflationary pressures on operating costs (e.g. expat levies, rising utility costs), we are more selective; focusing on names 
that are least affected by the regulations and that have attractive company specific growth stories. 
Commodities: As good as it gets for OPEC 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029461 
OPEC is succeeding at rebalancing the oil market. Our supply/demand balances reflect a faster-than-expected market tightening due to improving 
cyclical conditions, cold winter, and OPEC compliance. A gradual OPEC+ deal exit would keep spot and forward prices in a range with the market 
in backwardation, and preserve OPEC's long-run market share.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029463 
Opening New MEGA Trade:  
Long Saudi Equities ( Buy M1SAP on Swap / Liquidity $100mm a Day)  
- Potentially the EM Flow Story of 2018... if FTSE addition is announced on March 28th we expect an inflow of 
$5bn on a basket which trades 100mm USD a day (50X ADV)... this is even before MSCI announcement in June 
where inflows could be substantially higher 
The Most Powerful Macro Trades are when Macro Fundemantals + Flow Meet... This is Saudi in 2018 
Key Points:  
1. Saudi has significantly underperformed Oil by 14% last 6 months. With the recent introduction of the citizens account programme, 
subsidy cuts, pushing out the budget balance to 2023, and the news of increased handouts, Saudi should re correlate with oil and move higher 
from here. 
2. Saudi equities remain under-owned globally --) foreign ownership of Saudi equities is at 1.3% vs Russia 70%, Turkey 55%, South Africa 
50%, Brazil 45%, UAE 20%, Qatar 10% 
3. Good liquidity vs other EMs but volume trading at lows relative to history -4 Tadawul ADV close to all-time lows at $1bn (10yr range is 
$1-8bn) 
4. Major index events in 2018/19 with FTSE announcement on 28th March next catalyst-4 FTSE announcement could trigger inflows of up 
to $5bn . Combined with the MSCI announcement later this year, potential active and passive inflows can total $15-$40bn. So the potential of at  
least $20bn inflows on a basket which trades 100mm USD a day (200 Days Volume) ?  
5. In comparison, during the MSCI UAE and Qatar inclusions, UAE was trading 10% below historic avg @14x PE and rerated to 22x into MSCI 
EM inclusion with Dubai up +110% (vs +47% prey year). Qatar was trading inline with historic avg @11x PE and rerated to 18x MSCI EM inclusion 
with Qatar up +60% (vs +9% prey year) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029464 
6. Saudi risk indicators at 2015 pre-crisis levels 4 Saudi 5yr CDS is trading at 76 vs 40-210 3yr range; SAR 2yr fwd suggests market is less 
worried about depeg fears and forward points can be used as a macro hedge 
7. Valuations & dividend yields remain attractive 4 Market trades at a 10% discount (13.5x) to its historic PE (Saudi PE range is 10-
26x). Avg dividend yield is 3.6% with 45 stocks yield more than 4%.

Subject: Will Cohen Cooperate? Tenuous Finances May Provide Crucial Clues
From: richard kahn

shockingly it appears he has some money in real estate deals_ 
Will Cohen Cooperate? Tenuous Finances May Provide Crucial Clues 
2018-04-27 08:00:00.2 GMT 
By Shahien Nasiripour and Caleb Melby 
(Bloomberg) -- In the two weeks since federal agents seized 
the files of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's personal 
attorney and fixer, a question has hovered: Will Cohen cooperate 
with investigators? 
His decision could depend in part on whether he can readily 
shoulder the enormous legal fees required to fight a federal 
probe of this magnitude. 
At first blush, Cohen looks like a pretty rich man. He 
drives a white Rolls Royce, sports a $50,000 watch and owns a 
fair amount of Manhattan real estate. 
But just as his loyalty to Trump is coming under scrutiny, 
a more tenuous financial picture is emerging. A taxi business he 
and his wife built is deeply in debt and losing money daily, his 
commercial real estate is throwing off only modest income, and 
his legal and consulting work is on hold while he remains under 
investigation. 
Cohen declined repeated requests to comment. 
The owners of 32 New York City taxi licenses -- known as 
medallions -- he and his wife, Laura, took out at least 16 loans 
based on their once-soaring value, liens show. With the rise of 
Uber and Lyft, the price of a medallion has fallen from more 
than $1 million to around $163,000 in the past four years. 
Income from the taxi business has plummeted, and millions of 
dollars of the Cohens' loans went under water. Their bank said 
in a November public filing that it had loans out to three taxi 
borrowers, and all were at high risk of default. 
Suspended Medallions 
Unpaid taxes and fines have piled up at the Cohen taxi 
companies, triggering a suspension of about half of the 
medallions, city records show, squeezing cash flow. 
Whatever monthly income the cabs once produced almost 
certainly fell well short of the debt payments owed to Sterling 
National Bank, their Montebello, New York-based lender. Sterling 
has foreclosed on operators in similar situations and sued them 
but appears to be taking a less-confrontational approach with 
the Cohens. On Tuesday, the bank agreed to new loans for their 
companies and to Cohen personally, public filings show. Sterling 
declined to comment. 
The taxi business isn't the only part of Cohen's empire 
that's suffering. The law firm Squire Patton Boggs said it ended 
its "strategic alliance" with Cohen after law enforcement raided 
his offices, and the rest of his legal work could decline for 
the same reason. Cohen, 51, makes others' ugly problems 
disappear, a practice that was previously lucrative. Essential 
Consultants LLC, a company affiliated with Cohen, was paid 
$250,000 after he negotiated a $1.6 million payment to a former 
Playboy model on behalf of Republican National Committee 
official Elliott Broidy, according to a Wall Street Journal 
report. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020437 
Sean Hannity 
Cohen has said in court that he had only three legal 
clients during the past year: Broidy, Trump and talk-show host 
Sean Hannity. He gave seven others "strategic advice and 
business consulting." 
Last month Cohen said he borrowed from his home-equity 
credit line to make a $130,000 payment in October 2016 to Stormy 
Daniels, an adult-film star who says she had sex with Trump. 
In a Thursday morning appearance on "Fox & Friends," Trump 
distanced himself from Cohen, saying he did only "a tiny, tiny 
little fraction" of Trump's legal work, but it included 
representation "on this crazy Stormy Daniels deal." 
Russian Interference 
Cohen is under investigation for bank fraud and violating 
campaign-finance law. But his decade at Trump's side as his 
lawyer and enforcer could yield information he might trade to 
investigators looking into the Trump campaign and Russia's 
interference in the U.S. election. 
Still, if he chooses to defend himself, Cohen does have 
assets. Companies he signs for own two investment properties 
purchased in 2015. The larger one, with 92 units on New York's 
Upper East Side, is 38 percent owned by Cohen's companies. The 
businesses also appear to be the sole owner of a downtown 
building with 20 units. 
Together they likely generate less than $1 million in 
annual net income for Cohen's companies after accounting for 
partner interests, expenses and financing costs, data compiled 
by Bloomberg show. Debt against the buildings is low, meaning 
that Cohen could tap them for cash. Last October, the Cohens 
sold a unit at Trump World Tower, near the United Nations, for 
$3.3 million. 
Cohen has been a savvy property investor. He previously 
owned four buildings in need of repairs in Lower Manhattan, 
rehabilitated them and sold them for $32 million in 2014, more 
than doubling his initial investment. 
'Cautious, Methodical' 
Richard Guarino, a partner at Friedman-Roth Realty, has 
worked with Cohen on a handful of deals, including the purchase 
of his Upper East Side building. As a real estate investor, 
Cohen is "cautious, methodical, smart and, I think, 
conservative," Guarino says. 
Cohen's current business partners are a family of New York 
real estate lawyers headed by Herbert Chaves. The family, having 
just sold a plot of Brooklyn land to a partnership including the 
family company of Jared Kushner, were looking to reinvest their 
gains when they bought Cohen's Lower Manhattan buildings in 
2014. Months later, they partnered with Cohen to buy the Upper 
East Side property, 330 East 63rd Street. Guarino, a broker on 
the deal, says he dealt only with Cohen, who served as a 
representative for the investor group even though the Chaves 
family companies hold the majority stake. 
Purchased for $58 million, the squat, brown-brick seven-
story building has only a $17 million mortgage, meaning Cohen's 
share has at least $15 million of equity he could borrow against 
if his partners allowed him to do so. Another property at 133 
Avenue D, not previously reported to be owned by Cohen, has at 
least $5 million of equity not tapped by a mortgage. But more 
debt means more risk and could hurt Cohen later if the taxi 
business doesn't turn around to help cover higher interest 
payments. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020438 
Park Avenue 
One property that may prove harder to extract cash from: 
Cohen's palatial Park Avenue home. Purchased for $5 million in 
2005, the sprawling 10th-floor unit used to be three separate 
apartments and has four bedrooms. It could be worth $8 million 
or more, based on comparable sales. 
In late 2015, the Cohens moved the property into a type of 
trust designed to limit tax exposure when transferring property 
to heirs. The trust structure has tax consequences for typical 
mortgages, but those could be dodged if the Cohens took out an 
interest-only loan. 
In February 2016, Laura Cohen, in her role as a trustee of 
the new entity, did just that, taking out a revolving $500,000 
home-equity line of credit against the property from First 
Republic Bank. It was the first time the family had borrowed 
against the property since a loan of more than $2 million 11 
years earlier when they bought it, property records show. 
There are also Cohen's in-laws, who may pitch in to a 
legal-defense effort. Fima and Ania Shusterman, who haven't 
responded to requests for comment, emigrated from Ukraine and 
built their own taxi empire over decades while helping Cohen 
expand his across New York and Chicago. They own three units in 
Trump World Tower. In an indication of their willingness to help 
those close to them, the couple have lent $20 million to another 
Ukranian couple in the taxi business, Semyon and Yasya Shtayner 
and their companies.

AT&T confirms it paid Trump lawyer 
Michael Cohen for 'insights' on 
administration 
11:57 AM ET Fri, 4 May 2018 01:18

Michael Cohen, longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, 
arrives at the United States District Court Southern District of New York on April 26, 2018 
in New York City. 
Telecommunications giant AT&T said Tuesday night that it had paid President Donald  
Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen for "insights" about the Trump administration. 
AT&T's admission came after a lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels claimed the company, 
drug giant Novartis and a Russian oligarch had all made payments to Cohen's shell 
company. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 016218 
Daniels lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said AT&T had made four separate payments of $50,000  
apiece to Cohen's company, for a total of $200,000 in late 2017 and into early 2018.  
That company, Essential Consultants, was created by Cohen in October 2016 and soon after 
was used to make a $130,000 hush-money payment to Daniels. 
In a prepared statement to CNBC, AT&T said Cohen's company "was one of several firms 
we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration." 
"They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017," 
AT&T said. 
The company did not say how much it had paid Cohen, who was the president's personal 
lawyer at the time. 
AT&T is in the midst of pursuing an $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. The U.S. 
Justice Department has sued to block that deal. 
In a report on Cohen's company, Avenatti's law firm said that Novartis in late 2017 and early 
2018 made four separate payments to Essential Consultants totaling nearly $400,000. 
"Following these payments, reports surfaced that Mr. Trump took a dinner with the 
incoming CEO of Novartis before Mr. Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in 
Davos, Switzerland in late January 2018," Avenatti's report said. 
That CEO, Vas Narasimhan, was joined with a group of other companies' executives at that  
dinner.  
A Novartis spokesperson said in a statement that "any agreements with Essential Consultants 
were entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have 
expired. 
Avenatti's report says another company, Korea Aerospace Industries LTD, paid Essential 
Consultants $150,000 in November 2017. 
Avenatti's client Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 by 
Essential Consultants on the eve of the 2016 presidential election. 
Daniels says the money was in exchange for her signing a deal that required her to remain 
silent about an affair she claims to have had with Trump in 2006, shortly after the birth of 
his youngest son. 
The White House has denied that Trump had sex with the adult film actress. 
Neither the White House nor Cohen had an immediate comment on Avenatti's new 
allegations about payments to Cohen's company.

Tae Kim 
'74-14130r. 
Several of President Donald Trump's advisors are pushing him to pardon Michael Milken, 
Bloomberg News reported Friday. 
Michael Milken, 71, was known as the "junk bond king" in the 1980s and was convicted for 
securities fraud. 
Bloomberg said former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, senior advisor Jared Kushner and attorney Rudy  
Giuliani support the pardon for Milken. 
Milken has a net worth of $3.7 billion, according to Forbes. The financier, who pioneered 
the market for high-yield bonds while at Drexel Burnham Lambert, was sentenced to 10 
years in prison and permanently banned from the securities industry by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. His prison term was reduced to two years. 
The White House and a spokesperson for the Milken Institute did not immediately respond 
to requests for comment.

Bookstore owner calls police after customer 
confronted Steve Bannon 
By Morgan Gstalteduly 07, 2018 - 10:38 PM EDT 
A Richmond, Va., bookstore owner said he called the police on Saturday after former White 
House chief strategist Stephen Bannon was confronted in his store. 
Nick Cooke, owner of Black Swan Books, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that a woman 
called Bannon a "piece of trash." 
The woman then left the store after Cooke said he called 911. 
"Steve Bannon was simply standing, looking at books, minding his own business. I asked 
her to leave, and she wouldn't. And I said, 'I'm going to call the police if you don't,' and I 
went to call the police and she left," Cooke said. "And that's the end of the story." 
Bannon grew up in Richmond, the newspaper noted. 
The Richmond Police Department confirmed the call was made but the call was canceled 
before officers responded. 
"We are a bookshop. Bookshops are all about ideas and tolerating different opinions and not 
about verbally assaulting somebody, which is what was happening," Cooke said.

Bannon joins a growing list of political figures associated with President Trump who have 
been confronted in public in recent weeks. 
Protesters in Kentucky followed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to his 
car while he was leaving a Louisville restaurant on Saturday, threatening to vote him out of

Others, including White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Department of

I understand your frustrations and appreciate your willingness to figure out a solution. I have some ideas 
which I will send you over the weekend if that is OK. 
Re Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been 
a lot of focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we 
hear from management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. 
This morning the pricing is as follows: 
Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10 
Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90 
Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept 
puts. However I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management before 
August expiry.

Congressional candidate compares Melania 
Trump to prostitute 
By Chris Perez 
A congressional candidate from Oregon has caused an uproar on social media after 
comparing first lady Melania Trump to a prostitute. 
"Did you know the First Lady works by the hour?" tweeted independent House candidate  
Mark Roberts on Monday, using the hashtags "#thinkdirty" and "#hoebag." 
Twitter users were quick to blast the politician for his crude comment, with some calling on 
him to pull out of the 2nd Congressional District race for Republican incumbent Greg 
Walden's seat. 
"Very unprofessional on your part," tweeted one person. "Grow up and stick to the issues, so 
the voters in your district can decide on your stand regarding the issues." 
Another added, "Wow no class Mark. You're definitely using liberal tactics and it makes me 
wonder if you really are a conservative at all." 
Roberts sparked the social media storm on Monday afternoon after replying to a tweet from 
Charlie Kirk, president of the right-wing youth organization Turning Point USA. Kirk had 
compared Melania's staff numbers to those of former first lady Michelle Obama. 
"Did you know: There are thirty-nine fewer staffers dedicated to The First Lady of the 
United States (FLOTUS) than under Obama," Kirk tweeted, referencing data reported in 
January. 
"There are only five staffers dedicated to Melania Trump vs. forty-four staffers who served 
Michelle Obama," he said. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030326 
Political experts told The Oregonian on Tuesday that Roberts' reply completely railroaded 
his chances of unseating Walden in a race that was already said to be a longshot. 
"If he wins, I'll sell my house and donate to charity," joked Jim Moore, political science 
professor at Pacific University. 
Roberts is apparently known for making crude and outlandish remarks on Twitter, most of 
which have been aimed at politicians. 
"#NikkiHaley very hot," he once tweeted, in reference to a TV appearance she made last 
year. 
"Important stuff," Roberts added. 
Describing Illinois Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, the independent candidate tweeted: 
"Hot, tough & smart!" 
Commenting on a video featuring President Trump, he said: "It looks like he's morphing 
into a woman, get that man a haircut and non fat chocolate cake!" 
In response to the social media backlash he's been receiving, Roberts refused to apologize 
and instead cited the Constitution. 
"It's that whole 1st amendment thing," he tweeted on Tuesday, along with an official 
explanation from Twitter as to why his tweet about Melania hasn't been taken down. 
"We have investigated the reported content and could not identify any violations," a 
spokesperson said. "Accordingly, we have not taken any action at this time."

Steve Bannon almost appeared in Michael 
Moore's 'Fahrenheit 11/9' 
Steve Bannon was invited to be in Michael Moore's latest documentary, "Fahrenheit 11/9," 
and while the former White House strategist declined to go on camera, he did meet with 
Moore for two hours, the filmmaker revealed after the film's NYC premiere. 
After a Lincoln Center screening, Moore, at a Tavern on the Green party, revealed Bannon 
was almost in the film. "We wanted Steve Bannon to answer that first question in the film: 
'How the f—k did this happen?' " the liberal gadfly told guests. 
"It took a long time. We finally got him to come over, no cameras ... He said he wanted to 
talk to me first. And we talked to him for two hours." 
Ultimately, Bannon decided not to go on camera, but the conversation had a seismic impact 
on the finished film anyway. 
"He said something very profound to us, and it changed us and it changed the course of the 
film," Moore said of Bannon. "I asked him, 'How did you pull this [Trump's election] 
off?' And he said, 'It's a very easy answer. Our side, we go for the head wound. Your side, 
you have pillow fights.'" 
Moore continued, "That so f—ked us up to hear him say that ... watching him smirk as he 
said it. As soon as he left, we decided to watch the film... and put the pillow fight filter." 
One example Moore gave of a change to his film post-Bannon was a line about news 
networks being run by men, from "most" to "all." 
"It's amazing how we talk as liberals. We always want to be nice and maybe be fair," Moore 
explained. 
The film also jabs at the media, highlighting major newsmen who have turned out to be 
predators, including Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030878 
A spy told us, "Everyone in the theater hissed when Les Moonves' face came up on-screen." 
Moore also held a Q&A after the screening. 
The movie's already premiered in Moore's hometown of Flint, Mich., and played the 
Toronto International Film Festival.

The 7.8% intraday peak-to-trough decline in US equities between September 21st and October 11th 
has rattled investor confidence. Numerous headlines of stock market "carnage" have further eroded 
their confidence. As a result, some of our clients have asked whether this drop signifies the beginning 
of the end of a nearly 10-year bull market. 
We do not think so. So far, this pullback is actually smaller than the two prior downdrafts we 
experienced in late January and in mid-March, neither of which derailed the US economy nor the bull 
market. The steady factors we highlighted in our annual Outlook—such as economic growth, benign 
inflation, robust earnings, and low probability of recession—have not dissipated. Furthermore, while 
the investor focus has shifted to the risks around the unsteady undertow, most of these factors are, 
on balance, less concerning today than they were at the beginning of 2018. 
Of course, that is not the case across all geopolitical concerns. While trade tensions with Mexico and 
Canada have abated, those with China have certainly deteriorated and will continue to do so for the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026894 
foreseeable future. But, in aggregate, there has been more improvement than deterioration, in our 
view. 
In this Sunday Night Insight, we will provide a brief update on the steady factors and unsteady 
undertow. We then conclude with our view that the steady factors will likely continue to win this tug-of-
war between the two. 
Steady Factors 
While the headlines warn of equity market carnage, the facts do not support such alarming headlines. 
The S&P 500 is still up 5.1% on a year-to-date total return basis and financial conditions remain at 
easier levels today than they did when the Federal Reserve began this tightening cycle in 2015, 
despite the recent decline in equities and 0.76 percentage point increase in 10-year Treasury yields 
year-to-date. Most importantly, as highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, we are 
in "extraordinary times" of steady growth and low inflation. 
Economic Growth 
Economic growth remains firm in the US. Both the Institute for Supply Management leading indexes 
for manufacturing and non-manufacturing remain at very strong levels. Current activity indicators of 
real GDP growth average about 3.5% for the third quarter and closer to 4% for the fourth quarter. 
Forecasts for third quarter real GDP average 3.8% and fourth quarter forecasts are about 
2.8%. While growth is slowing from the 4.2% estimate of the second quarter, it is still forecast to be 
above trend and we believe a modest slowdown is certainly preferable to continued growth at a pace 
that was likely unsustainable and possibly even inflationary. 
In aggregate, the economic data since the intraday peak of US equities on September 21st does not 
point to any worrisome slowdown in GDP growth or the pace of employment. In fact, while the recent 
134K increase in non-farm payrolls was less than expectations, revisions to earlier months offset the 
modest headline miss and the unemployment rate still fell to 3.7%. Furthermore, this 134k increase 
is above the estimated sustainable level of employment growth based on population growth and 
changes in labor force participation, which our colleagues in Goldman Investment Research estimate 
is around 96k. Importantly, a modest slowdown in the 3-month average of non-farm payrolls, which 
currently stands at a very robust 190k jobs, is more likely to keep inflation in check. 
Robust Earnings and Buybacks 
Continued above-trend economic growth is supporting solid corporate fundamentals. While many are 
quick to dismiss this strength to US tax reform, it is only half the story. Earnings before interest and 
taxes (EBIT) expanded by a very healthy 12% in the first half of this year and are expected to grow by 
double-digits again in the third quarter. This robust organic profit growth is also fueling sizable 
corporate buybacks—a key source of equity market support. Our colleagues on the corporate 
buyback desk expect the highest dollar amount for buybacks on record in 2018, with $1tn in 
authorizations and $850bn in executed buybacks. 
Even so, such robust earnings growth has begun to foster concern that we have reached a peak in 
EPS growth. While we do expect the pace of growth to slow next year, a local peak in earnings 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026895 
growth has not signified an imminent peak in the S&P 500 historically. In fact, about 3/4ths of market 
peaks occurred more than two years after the peak in the growth rate of earnings. Moreover, stock 
market returns have remained healthy during this period, with high odds of a positive outcome over 
the subsequent 6-24 months (see Exhibit 1). In short, the market ultimately follows the path of 
earnings and while their growth rate may be slowing, their absolute level is still rising.

Inflation data has remained at relatively low levels for all of 2018, as shown in Exhibits 2 and 3. In 
fact, some of the most recent data released in October have ticked slightly lower. Average hourly 
earnings dropped to 2.8% from the prior month's level of 2.9%. Headline CPI dropped to 2.3% from 
2.7% and Core CPI ex-food and energy remain at a low 2.2%, unchanged from the prior month. The 
Federal Reserve's preferred inflation indicator, Core PCE, also remains low at 2.0% which is in line 
with the Federal Reserve's target, and unchanged from the prior month. 
While 10-year Treasury yields have risen by 0.76% (or 76 basis points) over the course of 2018, we 
do not think the resulting 3.2% yield is enough to derail US economic growth. Keep in mind that most 
of the recent increase since late August was due to stronger real growth rather than runaway inflation 
expectations. We expect interest rates to range between 3.0% and 3.5% in 2019 with a midpoint of 
3.25%, barring any major geopolitical conflicts such as one between US and China and or escalating 
conflicts in the Middle East.

Of course, the recent backup in interest rates is providing equity investors with another source of 
angst. Yet our work suggests there are several reasons why rates could continue to rise before 
becoming a material headwind for stocks. First, the 4% trend growth rate of nominal US GDP—
reflecting 2% real growth and 2% inflation—remains comfortably above the 10-year Treasury yield of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026897 
3.2% (i.e. the cost of borrowing). Stocks typically struggle when the cost of borrowing exceeds the 
nominal growth of the economy (see Exhibit 4). Second, the recent backup in interest rates was 
driven primarily by improving real growth expectations, not higher inflation. This distinction is critical, 
because higher rates in response to improving real growth tend to benefit earnings sufficiently to 
overcome the downward pressure they place on valuation multiples. Finally, it will take a number of 
years before higher rates meaningfully impact aggregate S&P 500 interest expense, considering 91`)/0 
of S&P 500 debt is fixed-rate and only 13% matures over the next two years.

Low Probability of Recession 
We continue to maintain a low, 10%, probability of recession driven by: 
• The positive trend of leading economic indicators 
• Low levels of inflation 
• The continued slow but steady pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. We believe that 
Federal Reserve Chairman Powell's recent commentary indicates that the FOMC will continue to be 
driven by data and financial market conditions. Their stated goal is to extend this expansion 
"indefinitely." While the Federal Reserve dots point towards four more interest rate hikes by the end 
of 2019, we do not think that such hikes materially increase the odds of a recession in an economy 
that continues to grow at levels that are generally regarded as above trend growth in the US.

Unsteady Undertow 
As market observers attempt to explain the recent drop in US equities, the risks of geopolitical factors 
have garnered considerable attention. Potential US retaliation over the recent disappearance of a 
Saudi journalist has only added fuel to the fire of worries given the risk that oil exports could be used 
as a political weapon in a world with tighter oil supply thanks to impending US sanctions on Iran. 
As we review the geopolitical developments of 2018, it is clear that some of the risks have abated 
while others have increased. With the exception of a significant spike in oil prices due to the impact of 
sanctions on Iran or any escalation in US-Saudi tensions, we believe that the net impact of these 
shifts is not material enough to derail the US economic expansion or bull market. 
Risks that have abated  
Mexico: the election of the left-of-center populist president (Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador referred 
to as AMLO) has reduced fear of a reversal of recent reforms. While concerns about fiscal profligacy 
and reverting to a nationalist energy policy that reduces oil production may reappear, AMLO does not 
take office until the end of the year. 
Brazil: The strong showing of Jair Bolsonaro, a law-and-order former army captain, in the first round 
of elections and the latest data that points to a 75% probability of Bolsonaro becoming the next 
president of Brazil has provided a boost to the Brazilian real. His current standing has substantially 
reduced the election of another left-wing worker's party candidate who would keep the status quo in 
Brazil. 
NAFTA: The agreement on a revised NAFTA deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico on 
September 30th meaningfully reduced the risk of the US withdrawal from NAFTA. While the new 
agreement, US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), has not been ratified by the Mexican and 
Canadian national parliaments nor by the US congress, and a divided congress after the mid-term 
elections may lead to some uncertainty, we believe it is likely to be ratified. 
US-EU Trade Friction: Tension between the US and European Union eased significantly after a July 
2018 deal between European Commission President Juncker and President Trump to "work together 
toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods". The 
coast is not totally clear given the threat of auto tariffs, but we do not anticipate any significant 
increase in trade rhetoric in the near future. 
Risks that have increased  
China: The trade war with China continues to escalate and as we have stated before, we believe that 
it cannot be resolved simply by China importing more US goods. The issues range from: 
• A large and growing trade deficit with China 
• Industrial policies & unfair trade practices that reduce competition, such as subsidies and 
"dumping good at below-market prices" 
• "Made in China 2025" policies which "harm US companies" 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026900 
• Uneven tariff rates and the banning of some US goods 
• Intellectual property theft 
• Forced technology transfer 
• Strategic US technology acquisitions 
• Outright cyber theft 
• Foreign ownership restrictions 
Recent headlines that the trade war may be escalating to a cold war are not without merit, as we 
believe that US-China relations are changing on a more structural basis and will have a longer-term 
impact. On a short-term basis, however, US exposure to China is limited with merchandise exports, 
corporate profits and foreign claims at about 1% of GDP. As seen in Exhibit 7, the Chinese equity 
markets have also deteriorated much more significantly than US markets in 2018. 
Of course, specific stocks with greater exposure to China through higher sales have underperformed 
the S&P 500 by about 6% since the latest tariffs were imposed on $200bn of Chinese products, as 
shown in Exhibit 8.

Italy: Concerns about Italy have risen to peak levels since the election of a populist government in 
May and credit default swaps have increased to reflect these higher risks. The government's 
expansive fiscal plan, with a proposed budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP, may be rejected by the 
European Union commission and result in rating downgrades. While the EU is likely to manage this 
situation in its usual incremental and reactive way, the possibility of new elections in late 2019 
reigniting euro viability questions will keep Italy on our radar screens. 
BREXIT: It is hard to know whether Brexit risks are unchanged, higher or lower given the minute by 
minute headlines out of the UK. Our base case remains that while the internal politics of the 
Conservative party will keep uncertainty at elevated levels and the European Union will not 
compromise on its key tenants of free movement of goods, services, and people, the two sides will 
agree to a deal that defers the difficult choices on the shape of a final agreement with the EU until late 
2020. 
The Middle East: Risks in the Middle East have not changed substantially with respect to Iraq, Syria, 
or even the impositions of sanctions on Iran. However, the disappearance of the Saudi journalist who 
entered the Saudi Embassy in Turkey on October 2nd has the potential to raise risks to global oil 
supply. While there has been a global uproar, it is not yet clear whether the US will impose serious 
sanctions or Saudi Arabia would retaliate by reducing oil exports if the US finds sufficient evidence 
regarding the alleged killing of the Saudi journalist. The recession in 1973-74 was partly due to the 
quadrupling of oil prices due to the Arab Oil Embargo. Later in that decade, the Iranian Revolution 
and the Iran-Iraq War also led to a 2.5 times spike in oil prices that, along with Federal Reserve 
tightening by then Chairman Paul Volcker, led to a US recession. While we think it is unlikely that 
Saudi Arabia would react so aggressively in the face of serious US reprisals, we note that it remains a 
real risk.

Some Notable Observations 
US Equities Have Been Shunned All Along  
In both our 2018 Outlook and mid-year update, we highlighted the surprising absence of inflows into 
US equities based on flows into mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds. As shown in Exhibit 9, 
flows into US equities were negative in 2018, even before the recent downdraft. In fact, US equities 
have seen outflows of $81 billion through August 2018 (based on the most recent comprehensive 
data), while non-US developed equities and emerging market equities have had inflows of $72 billion 
and $20 billion respectively. This is further evidence of our view that while sentiment and short term 
positioning among speculators and hedge fund managers shifts frequently, more stable investors 
have shunned US equities during this long bull market in favor of other developed and emerging 
market equities and global bonds. 
This steady outflow of assets from US equities has been offset by record levels of stock buybacks by 
US companies given high levels of profitability and incremental cash from repatriation of overseas 
earnings, as mentioned above. 
Note: Based on ICI weekly estimates through August 30,2018. Flows exclude reinvested dividends.

Some Headwinds Facing the FANG MAN Stocks Will Persist 
The basket of FANGMAN (i.e. Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia) 
stocks have dropped across the board from their respective peak price levels, with Facebook's 29% 
decline the largest and Apple's 4% decline the smallest among the group. Even so, each of the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026903 
stocks, with the exception of Facebook, still have positive year-to-date returns and have outperformed 
the S&P 500, as shown in Exhibit 10. 
This is not a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities but rather an assertion that these 
stocks represent a small portion of S&P 500 earnings. Anyone looking to buy or sell single name 
equities should consult Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. 
Source: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. 
Nevertheless, we believe that some of the headwinds that have plagued this sector will continue. 
These include: 
• Data privacy issues impacting a broad range of companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, 
Alipay and Tencent. 
• High likelihood of greater regulatory scrutiny in the US2 and Europe as policy makers increasingly 
believe that these companies will not address "the privacy and security issues of social media 
users"3 on their own. 
• Increased focus by ESG investors (Environment, Social, and Governance) that many of the 
technology and social media companies are falling short on social and governance issues. 
While this basket of stocks may or may not lead the market in the future, it is important to note that 
they represent only 10% of S&P 500 earnings. 
Investment Implications 
The recent market downdraft has understandably rekindled fears that the longest bull market in 
history is coming to an end. While there are no certainties in investing, we do not think the odds 
support that conclusion based on our read of the steady and unsteady factors discussed above. Keep 
in mind that about 75% of historical US bear markets—defined here as equity market declines of 20% 
or more—have occurred during economic recessions. In fact, US equity returns have remained 
favorable until about five to six months prior to the onset of recession, highlighting the penalty for 
prematurely exiting the market (see Exhibit 11). With only 10% odds of recession over the next year, 
we think the economic backdrop remains favorable for stocks. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026904 
Source: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. 
Of course, none of the supportive factors discussed above precludes further bouts of equity volatility. 
As we highlighted at the beginning of the year, the historical probability of a 5% or greater correction 
from current valuation levels was 96%. Yet these statistics alone do not justify underweighting 
equities, since such pullbacks often occur after sizable equity rallies, as this year reminds us. 
Moreover, such pullbacks are quite normal historically. After all, stocks have suffered a median of two 
pullbacks of at least 5% and one of at least 10% per calendar year in the post-WWII period, leaving 
both the frequency and magnitude of this year's dips in line with past experience. Most importantly, 
years that experienced a similar number of pullbacks as 2018 nonetheless ended with a median gain 
of 6% and had 77% odds of a positive return. 
Conclusion 
Although we have painted a less alarmist view of recent market weakness, we are by no means 
Pollyannaish. While bull markets do not die of old age, they do become more susceptible to ailments 
over time. Yet as we survey the tug of war between the steady factors and the unsteady undertow, 
we do not think the balance of risks is strong enough to topple the ongoing US expansion and the 
continued growth of corporate earnings it supports. 
That said, this viewpoint does not preclude further market volatility and the market may still make new 
lows if the current downdraft persists. But history suggests the bull market is likely to continue until 
about 5-6 months prior to the end of this economic expansion. Thus, it will take a significant increase 
in the odds of an imminent recession to provide the trigger—that has been lacking thus far—to 
tactically underweight equities. In the interim, we continue to recommend that clients maintain their 
strategic allocation to US equities.

New book paints sordid picture of Trump real estate 
deal involving Russian oligarch and Jeffrey Epstein

A new book claims Jeffrey Epstein played a key role in a shady Palm Beach real estate deal between President 
Donald Trump and a Russian oligarch. 
Michael Wolff's forthcoming book, "Siege," details the 2004 property deal that involved the future president, 
Deutsche Bank, a child predator and an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, reported The Guardian.

ADVERTISING 
According to Wolff's account, Epstein showed his friend Trump a $55 million mansion he planned to buy, but 
Trump instead went behind his back to buy the foreclosed property for about $40 million. 
Epstein didn't believe Trump could raise that much money on his own, through an entity called Trump 
Properties LLC that was entirely financed by Deutsche Bank, Wolff wrote. 
The billionaire financier knew Trump had been loaning out his name in real estate deals for a fee, and he 
suspected the freshly minted reality TV star was fronting for the mansion's real owners. 
74-.PUP. 
Epstein threatened to expose the deal until he found himself under investigation by Palm Beach police for child 
sex abuse and human trafficking, and he eventually served 13 months in county jail as part of a controversial 
plea agreement brokered by Trump's future Labor Secretary Alex Acosta. 
Trump later put the mansion on the market for $125 million, despite making only minor improvements to the 
property. 
It was purchased for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Kremlin-linked industrialist — which meant Trump 
made $55 million on the deal despite risking none of his own money. 
Wolff offers two possible theories for the deal. 
The author suspects that Trump may have earned a fee for hiding a shadow owner who possibly was funneled 
cash by Rybolovlev for reasons beyond the property's value. 
Or, Wolff theorizes, Rybolovlev essentially bought the house from himself, with Trump as an intermediary, to 
launder ill-gotten money. 
"This," Wolff wrote, "was Donald Trump's world of real estate." 
Rybolovlev tore down the mansion in 2016 and sold off the property as three lots for less than the $115 million 
he had invested in it.

Given the risk of further restrictive trade measures, we answer investors' top questions. We expect 
shares to remain choppy, with a near-term floor around $160. Our estimates are unchanged but 
peer multiple contraction drives our SoTP-driven PT to $231 (from $240). 
What is the latest view on iPhone demand in China? On Apple's April 30th earnings call, CEO Tim 
Cook noted that the November-December period was likely to be the trough in iPhone demand in 
China, following an improvement in performance during the March quarter helped by iPhone price 
cuts, VAT tax rollbacks, increased financing options and better consumer confidence. Data from 
push-messaging service provider Jigaung shows that the improvement in iPhone demand likely 
persisted through April, where Apple gained over 175bps of Chinese smartphone installed base 
share Y/Y (1). However, the increasingly tough trade rhetoric and actions recently taken by US and 
Chinese authorities make it less likely this trend will continue into May/June. Late last week, 
following the Huawei blacklist, President Trump commented that "it's possible that Huawei would be 
________included in a trade deal", suggesting recent actions could be bargaining chips to use in trade 
negotiations that can be worked out by/around the G20 Summit in late June, but with Apple guiding 
June quarter revenue down 8% Q/Q (vs. trailing 3 year seasonality of -14% Q/Q), the risk remains 
that weaker near-term demand in China increases the risk of a revenue shortfall. For reference, we 
model 37M iPhone shipments in the June quarter (-10% Y/Y), in-line with iPhone builds, which 
implies a 5th consecutive quarter of double digit iPhone shipment declines in China. If we assume 
Chinese demand significantly weakens in the last 6 weeks of the quarter and iPhone shipments 
instead fall 50% Y/Y (a 10 point further deceleration from March Q declines), then we'd expect 2.3M 
lower iPhone units (-6% vs. our current model), $1.6B lower revenue (-2.9%) and a $0.05 hit to EPS 
(-2

Catching up on some reading and finally read trumps 100 pages of nonsense. Some interesting findings: 
1) foundation is inactive 
2) ironic that starett city largest federal subsidized housing project which trump had 4 percent interest was 
finally sold while he is president. 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2018/05/09/starrett-city-sells-giving-
trump-a-profit.amp.html  
3) other than doral and post office hotel no substantial income from any of his enties that he showed.. 
4) 30 pages of stock purchases and sales all 5-15k. 
5) cash in his name 25mm or less 
6) still has money in revocable trust from his father at jpm 1-5mm 
7) claims to have as much as 125mm in trump revocable trust at cap one, professional bank, signature bank and 
bank United but can be as little as 40mm it mins were real numbers. 
Didn't he once say he say he had billions of liquidity.. 
8) valued planes from 56 to over 86mm. Down from 300mm on earlier disclosures.. 
9) Bank used for last mortgage on ocean drive purchase is a coral gables bank that is opening in boca as well.
