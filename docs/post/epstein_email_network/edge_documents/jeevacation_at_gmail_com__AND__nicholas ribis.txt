Subject: Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash/Joe Cinque
From: nicholas ribis
To: jeevacation@gmail.com
Direction: nicholas ribis → jeevacation@gmail.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffrey --I thought you might be interested in this article-- Nick 
Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash 
President-elect Donald Trump rang in the new year together with Joseph "Joey No Socks" Cinque — a 
convicted felon with ties to notorious Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, a recently released video has 
revealed. 
Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News  , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad 
Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's 
Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. 
"The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare," Trump can be 
heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. 
Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. 
Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque "used to be 
friends with John Gotti," according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995  . 
Cinque was also "shot three times and left for dead" in a 1980 incident that authorities described as "a hit," 
according to the profile. 
Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. 
An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a 
company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, 
casinos and private clubs with so-called "Star Diamond" awards "of true excellence in hospitality." 
The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as "trustees" to the company are 
Trump friends or business associates. 
Trump, meanwhile, was listed on the company's website as its "ambassador extraordinaire," and he even 
appeared in a 2009 tribute video to Cinque in which he said, "There's nobody like him. He's a special guy." 
But when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal 
past. 
"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it," the President-elect said at the time. "You don't tend to look 
up his whole life story." 
The Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows 
Cinque or why they appeared together Saturday. 
While standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of 
nightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a 
Mexican border wall. 
"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall," the President-elect told the raucous crowd. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033210 
"And speaking of walls," he continued. "In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in 
Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running 
properly." 
ISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack  , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more 
wounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a "heroic soldier of the caliphate." The suspect  
had yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. 
The President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking 
points, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a "great" and "beautiful" wall. 
But his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting 
in November that it might actually end up "part wall, part fence."

I thought you might be interested in this article: 
Manafort ratted on Donald Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer  
Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort alerted authorities to Donald Trump Jr.'s infamous meeting 
with the Russian lawyer during his father's presidential campaign. 
Manafort, who is facing increasing pressure from U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller, divulged Trump Jr.'s 
meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya about three months ago, Bloomberg reported. 
Responding to a congressional request for information, Manafort revealed the meeting and provided 300 
documents, although FBI agents went on to raid his Virginia home two weeks ago. 
Trump, responding to news of the raid, said, "I was very, very surprised to see it... .I've always found Paul 
Manafort to be a very decent man." 
Investigators are looking into accusations of money laundering in an attempt to pressure Manafort into 
cooperating with the probe into the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia, two sources told Reuters. 
"If Mueller's team can threaten criminal charges against Manafort, they could use that as leverage to convince 
him to cooperate," said one of the sources. 
But the former campaign manager's spokesman Jason Maloni said, "Paul Manafort is not a cooperating 
witness." 
Maloni also told Bloomberg that Manafort was enlisting the services of a D.C.-based law firm Miller & 
Chevalier,which focuses on tax law, to replace WilmerHale, where Mueller previously worked. 
Mueller's investigation has extended to global bank transactions involving Manafort, as well as his business 
partner Rick Gates and son-in-law, Jeffrey Yohai. 
Yohai, who is under investigation for real estate deals he made with Manafort, turned over documents to 
Mueller's probe more than two months

Federal prosecutors are investigating whether U.S. President Donald Trump's inaugural 
committee misspent some of the funds it raised, the Wall Street Journal reported on 
Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The probe opened by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is examining whether some of the 
committee's donors gave money in exchange for policy concessions, influencing 
administration positions or access to the incoming administration, the Journal said.
