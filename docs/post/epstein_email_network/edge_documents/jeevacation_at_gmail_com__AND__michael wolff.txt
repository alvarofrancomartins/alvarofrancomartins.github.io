prostittion is a state crime, never before a man in his own house charged with soliciting. ! in Florida first 
offenders are required to take a sex ed class and get pre trial diversion, no criminal record. . . there is a 
felony solication for the THIRD offense. . A grand jury was held and they found me guilty of one count of 
felony solitciation. because there were many girls. . mandatory diversion. sentence. !!!! a grand jury 
. ususally only for capital murder cases. . Recarey and Reiter ( police chief). pulled my garbage for months, 
and surveilled the house . letting all the gilrs come and go ? ! called in the FBI. they did not like the grand 
jury result. and released to the press, the raw sewage of police interviews , ie, no girl was cross examined 
EVER. . Unheard of . - the girls retunred the house multiplie times. for 200 dollars for a rub and 
tug. . no sex. . some worked in the locak massage parlors, most in thier mid twenties.. There is only 
press stories told my strippers of me buying my girlfiedn from slovakia from her parents . girls under 
15. . all made up to get press. . FBI / puts a task force together title" operation leap year" to investigate 
my personal massage activity ?! nuts. interviews my chiropractor ? medical info. . etc. 
worked at Mara Lago. Trump knew of it. and came to my house many times during that 
period. The testimony of the houseman John allessi confiremed it. He never got a massage. 
abe gosman a friend of mine. ran into financial difficulty with assited living homes. . His home was listed 
at 45 million dollars. with no takers for months on end . He and I agreed a price of 30m. ( His wife . 
ends up going to jail for lying to the bankrupty trustee about her jewelry. ) this is in the summer of 04. . I 
became the stalking horse bidder at 36 m. ie if someone bid higher I would receive a fee. 
trump buys the house at the telephone auction. only me trump andd his friend pulty the developer. 
He quickly puts it on the market for 125 million, serves the purpose of a justification for a high sale later 
. . and no one will touch it. it is is bough in the name of trump properties 11c.. no idea who owns it. or 
what else it" owns ". 
Three years later 08 he sells it to Ryboloolev for approx 100 million. He should have had a 50 million plus 
capital gain. he tells people and press he spent 20-30 m to fix up. that would justifiy a reduction in captial 
gains, key question how did he report the sale , if he did at all on his 08 tax return. 
He has no money. when he buys the house. His biz model is putting his name on a real estate development and 
gets a fee for using his name. The hotel biz is just that. someone else buys the hotel. hoping to make a profit 
from its operation and eventual sale. Trump put his name on it, and get a 2 % fee and maybe a piece of the 
profit if any on sale. He touts the project as " his " . just as in his current financial statements on file as 
president he lists his " income " as the GROSS receipts of the clubs, with no expenses deducted. not his 
personal revenue. ie the doral golf club loses money every year. it pays out more than it takes in , but he lists 
the revenue as his income. AMAZING.

Apparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira Rosen, a 60 
Minutes producer and a friend of Bannon's, came with a message from SB: "You own me a few 
million." Rosen also says he believes SB now weighing the strategy of making a formal and public 
break with Trump. I can't get together today because I have to leave for DC at 11AM to speak to 800

Darren Indyke ]; 
Seems very good. Is there reason or opportunity here to evoke JE's Clinton connection? He had been publicly 
connected to the former President and became a proxy for the considerable anger at high levels of the Federal 
government that still surrounded Clinton. Likewise now, one reason to revive the story is that it is a way to tar a 
Trump administration official, who, in the normal course of his duties, happened to deal with the case.

Here goes: 
"Sweetheart deal! " So goes the critique of the resolution of a long-ago case involving our former client -- and 
now-friend -- Jeffrey Epstein. The critique is profoundly misplaced, supported neither by the law or the facts, 
nor by the structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, Jeffrey was subjected to an unprecedented 
federal intrusion into a quintessentially local criminal matter in south Florida. His offense to the social order --
involving sex for hire -- was entirely a matter entrusted to laws of the several States, not the federal 
government. His conduct -- a classic state offense --was being treated exactly that way by able, honest 
prosecutors in Palm Beach County, but the overweening federal government intruded where it did not 
belong. And now, over ten years after the fact, the current assault on federal decision-makers at the time, 
including now-Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta (then the United States Attorney in south Florida), condemns 
the federal authorities for not going far enough. 
The critics are entirely wrong. Neither the facts nor the law support the misguided criticisms being leveled by 
journalists and politicians at federal officials from over a decade ago -- including the highest levels of the 
Justice Department in Washington, D.C.. 
Here are the key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made businessman with no prior criminal history 
whatever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounts to solicitation of prostitution. That was wrong, and it was 
reasonably viewed as a violation of Florida state law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs and the 
like were involved, the unsavory facts were carefully assessed by experienced state prosecutors who 
aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the public 
order. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive 15-month 
investigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by a state grand jury 
on a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution. 
During that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met 
face-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility -- or lack thereof -- and considered 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030318 
the extent of exculpatory evidence. Then, after months of elaborate negotiations, the state prosecutors believed 
they had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely 
consistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants. 
Then, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office tried, to no avail, to fit Mr. Epstein's situation into 
its vision of what it viewed as a commercial trafficking ring targeting minors. This was anything but. At long 
last, the federal authorities acknowledged that stark reality and grudgingly agreed to defer prosecution to the 
state. But there was a huge catch. In the face of our arguments sharply condemning their overreach, the 
federal prosecutors insisted on many unorthodox requirements that tugged at fundamental values of due 
process. For example, the agreement required Mr. Epstein to pay an undisclosed list of asserted victims 
$150,000 each. Even more, the feds insisted that Jeffrey pay for an attorney to represent such unidentified 
victims if any chose to filed civil litigation against him. When asked what possible legal authority supported 
this extravagant exercise of national power, the feds lamely cited a wildly inapposite case from Alaska 
involving cocaine and forced on-the-street prostitution. Apples and oranges. 
Under the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was sentenced to jail. That would not have been the case under the 
agreed-upon state disposition of this non-violent, consensual commercial arrangement. Jeffrey complied, 
served that sentence, and in the process was treated exactly the same as other state-incarcerated 
individuals. His conduct was exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. He continued 
his work, including his many philanthropic efforts. 
Our friend Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. He has also paid out millions of dollars to the asserted 
victims and their highly-creative lawyers. For over ten years, he has lived an exemplary life, including 
carrying on his wide-ranging philanthropies. Those of us who represented him in the Florida proceedings -- for 
customary professional fees -- now count him as a trusted friend. 
Our nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human 
dignity. Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the 
workplace. But Jeffrey, an exemplary employer, has long since been called to account by the criminal justice 
system for his misdeeds of yesteryear. In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances, that 
unhappy chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-magnificent life should be allowed to close once and for all.

This is what I'm now going with—what do you think? 
In the White House, the President, to general surprise, announced that he would not accompany his family to 
Mar-a-Lago over the holidays—a confounding, even alarming, turn for anyone who knew how much he valued 
a golf-and-warm-weather opportunity over any presidential business. Melania certainly had no intention of 
staying behind. Among other issues, friends suggested that she was still furious about his fireside Christmas Eve 
chat with a seven-year-old boy, during which Trump asked the boy if he still believed in Santa. "Melania didn't 
think that was funny," said one aide. Trump was "clearly a guy who had never dealt with a seven-year-old." 
In an empty White House, Trump's personal secretary, 28-year-old Madeleine Westerhout, brought his 
papers and call sheets from the West Wing up to the residence, finding him, she told friends, in his underwear. 
And herein, suddenly, was another subplot. 
Westerhout had been the elevator girl in Trump Tower during the transition. The comely young woman ferrying 
dignitaries and job-seekers up to the President-elect soon became something of a meme herself Bannon recalled 
noting that Trump took a particular interest in her. A leering Trump kept repeating, "She's got a way about her," 
his signature, and creepy, stamp of approval for young women. 
Now the president was telling friends that he wasn't staying at the White House because of the shutdown—he 
was staying because he was "banging" Madeleine. 
Shutdown bravado? Locker room talk? Or all part of a new alternative reality that only he seemed to be living 
in?"

Apparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira Rosen, a 60

my producer's budget but then offered the opportunity to profess poetry for production funds . There may be 
someone as good in New York, but i'll never tell you and you really have a heck of a seminar table there. 
When do we do Whitman's "Song of Myself" 1-15 Who else is reading with us? I'm ready. 
A few other follow ups: 
David and Brigid point out that reality tv doesn't cost anything because it is, as it sounds, very low budget. 
No writing , no special expertise or knowledge or research , no archival footage , no copyright clearance, 
no actors, no travel beyond the one location, certainly no clinton or woody allen or justice elena kagan or 
david brooks or Lena Dunham or even Professor New. That said, I think If were hiring the crew id do it 
for less -- probably 1, 250,000 all in . But I haven't won 10 Emmys and David has . That has value too. As 
does Wgbh . But I'll be more prepared for the next conversation and want to be much more prepared for 
templeton, so thank you. 
I really liked Michael. I would like to send him some stuff, but in googling him I noticed that we have the 
same birthday! May I have his email? 
You are in! Yeay! Lets see what this may mean? I'll improve my numbers and you'll improve your deep

less -- probably 1, 250,000 all in . But I haven't won 10 Emmys and David has . That has value too. As does 
Wgbh . But I'll be more prepared for the next conversation and want to be much more prepared for 
templeton, so thank you. 
I really liked Michael. I would like to send him some stuff, but in googling him I noticed that we have the 
same birthday! May I have his email? 
You are in! Yeay! Lets see what this may mean? I'll improve my numbers and you'll improve your deep 
reading ?

Books and newspaper accounts of Trump's 45 years in business were full of his 
shady dealings, and the presidency had only helped to highlight them and to surface even 
juicier ones. Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and Trump's 
B-level real estate business was quite explicitly designed to appeal to money launderers. 
What's more, Trump's own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain billionaire 
lifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle 
schemes. Practically speaking, you couldn't miss him, as the Mueller investigation 
appeared to be finding. 
In November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein, the financier later caught in a scandal 
involving under-age prostitutes, agreed to buy out of bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, 
Florida for $30 million—a house that had been on the market for two years. Epstein and 
Trump had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, 
with Epstein often counseling Trump on his chaotic financial affairs. Epstein took Trump 
to see the Palm Beach house to advise him on construction issues involved with moving a 
swimming pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the house, an incredulous Epstein 
saw a severely cash-constrained Trump bid $41 million for the property, buying it 
through an entity called Trump Properties LLC, financed by Deutsche Bank. Trump, 
Epstein knew, had been renting his name, telling Epstein he ought to do the same—that 
is, for an ample fee, Trump was willing to serve as a front man to disguise the actual 
ownership in a real estate transaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of 
Trump's basic business model of licensing his name for commercial properties owned by 
someone else.) A furious Epstein, suspecting that the real owner was a Russian oligarch, 
who Trump knew, Dmitry Rybolovlev—part of the close Putin circle of government-
aligned industrialists in Russia—threatened to expose the deal, then getting extensive 
scrutiny in Florida papers. The fight became all the more bitter when, two months later, 
the house was put on the market for $125 million. Well known to Trump, who often saw 
Epstein at his current Palm Beach house, Epstein was visited almost every day, and had 
been for many years, by girls who he paid for massages with happy endings—girls 
recruited from local restaurants, strip clubs, and, also, Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Just as the 
threats and enmity of the two friends increased over the house sale, Epstein found 
himself under investigation by local Palm Beach police. Epstein's legal problems vastly 
escalated as the house, with only minor improvements, was bought for $96 million by 
Dmitry Rybolovlev. That is, Trump had either miraculously earned $55 million, without 
putting up a dime, or Rybolovlev, or someone such as Rybolovlev, paid Trump Properties, 
LLC—actual owner unknown—$96 million, thereby providing a clean payment of $55

million to someone. Ryboloyley might have, in effect, paid himself for the house, thereby 
cleansing the money. Epstein, on his part, would spend 12 months in jail on a prostitution 
charge. 
After the election, when Bannon was introduced to Epstein, Bannon told him, "You were 
the one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign." 
"And rightly so," said Epstein.

All good. I am everybody's darling. Have to keep reminding people that I am actually quite unpopular. 
Apparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira Rosen, a 60 Minutes 
producer and a friend of Bannon's, came with a message from SB: "You own me a few million." Rosen also 
says he believes SB now weighing the strategy of making a formal and public break with Trump. I can't get 
together today because I have to leave for DC at 11AM to speak to 800 book buyers (not to mention pre-signing 
800 books). Then tomorrow AM to LA to do Bill Maher show. Making money is hard work.

Looks like I can't get away. But will be back in NYC on Sunday. Let me know when you're back too. I have a 
bad feeling about this new Woody round. It could pull him into the general Harvey pool of the despised and 
shunned. Clearly what Ronan and company are hoping for. I think Bannon may be right. This is not going to 
end until Trump goes down.

Apparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira Rosen, a 60

New book paints sordid picture of Trump real estate 
deal involving Russian oligarch and Jeffrey Epstein

A new book claims Jeffrey Epstein played a key role in a shady Palm Beach real estate deal between President 
Donald Trump and a Russian oligarch. 
Michael Wolff's forthcoming book, "Siege," details the 2004 property deal that involved the future president, 
Deutsche Bank, a child predator and an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, reported The Guardian. 
ADVERTISING 
According to Wolff's account, Epstein showed his friend Trump a $55 million mansion he planned to buy, but 
Trump instead went behind his back to buy the foreclosed property for about $40 million. 
Epstein didn't believe Trump could raise that much money on his own, through an entity called Trump 
Properties LLC that was entirely financed by Deutsche Bank, Wolff wrote. 
The billionaire financier knew Trump had been loaning out his name in real estate deals for a fee, and he 
suspected the freshly minted reality TV star was fronting for the mansion's real owners. 
44,-er. 
Epstein threatened to expose the deal until he found himself under investigation by Palm Beach police for child 
sex abuse and human trafficking, and he eventually served 13 months in county jail as part of a controversial 
plea agreement brokered by Trump's future Labor Secretary Alex Acosta. 
Trump later put the mansion on the market for $125 million, despite making only minor improvements to the 
property. 
It was purchased for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Kremlin-linked industrialist — which meant Trump 
made $55 million on the deal despite risking none of his own money. 
Wolff offers two possible theories for the deal. 
The author suspects that Trump may have earned a fee for hiding a shadow owner who possibly was funneled 
cash by Ryboloyley for reasons beyond the property's value. 
Or, Wolff theorizes, Ryboloyley essentially bought the house from himself, with Trump as an intermediary, to 
launder ill-gotten money. 
"This," Wolff wrote, "was Donald Trump's world of real estate." 
Ryboloyley tore down the mansion in 2016 and sold off the property as three lots for less than the $115 million 
he had invested in it.

I was thinking of opening with you and Bannon talking about Trump. Would let you sound smart and offer what 
I think would be a crowd-pleasing perspective, and make you seem like a credible player--former friend of 
Trump, advisor to world leaders, sought after person, etc--without having to too much rehash old stuff. 
Doesn't seem like they can win...but who knows. I'm meeting Bannon had 3 tomorrow and will stay with him 
until the end.

Bannon's "nationalist-populist" platform is coherent, rational, and, apparently appealing to a great many people. 
I can't see why at this point he wouldn't want to use his world-stage stature to make an argument for it and to 
claim leadership of it. What does he have to lose? What else is there, except to suck up to Trump, and get the 
chance to be manhandled by him again?

Apparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira Rosen, a 60 Minutes

says he believes SB now weighing the strategy of making a formal and public break with Trump. I can't get

Subject: FYI 
To: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> 
Books and newspaper accounts of Trump's 45 years in business were full of his 
shady dealings, and the presidency had only helped to highlight them and to surface even 
juicier ones. Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and Trump's 
perceived A -level real estate business was quite explicitly designed to appeal to money 
launderers. What's more, Trump's own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain 
billionaire lifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle 
schemes. Practically speaking, you couldn't miss him, as the Mueller investigation 
appeared to be finding. 
In November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein, the financier later caught in a scandal 
involving under-age prostitutes, agreed to buy out of bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, 
Florida for $36 million—a house that had been on the market for two years. Epstein and 
Trump had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, 
with Trump always hopeful that Epstein would provide some of his financial expertise to 
enabvle h8im to survive. Trump was beholden to Deutsch Bank and was on the hook 
personally for 40 million dollars. 
Epstein took Trump to see the Palm Beach house to advise him on construction issues 
involved with moving the swimming pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the 
house, an incredulous Epstein saw a severely cash-constrained Trump bid $41 million for 
the property, buying it through an entity named Trump Properties LLC, ultimate owner 
unknown.. Trump, Epstein knew, had been in the buisness of leasing his name. Hotels are 
actually owned by others but renting the trump name would cost a percent or two. , 
Trump was willing to serve as a front man to disguise the actual ownership in a real estate 
transaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of Trump's basic business model of 
licensing his name for commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furious Epstein 
suspected that others actually owned the new house. then getting extensive scrutiny in 
Florida papers. The disagreement re the purchase of the house became all the more bitter 
when, two months later, the house was put on the market for $125 million. Well known to 
Trump, who often visited with Epstein at his Palm Beach house, whose visits were 
confirmed in depostions of Epsteins houseman. It appears that Epstein was visited almost 
every day, by and had been for many years, by girls who he paid for massages with happy 
endings—girls recruited, and who often returned to his house from the local massage 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030974 
parlors strip clubs, and, also, Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Just as the threats and enmity of the 
two friends increased over the house sale, Epstein found himself under investigation by 
local Palm Beach police. Epstein's legal problems vastly escalated but the new Trump 
property, with only minor improvements, was bought 3 years later in 08 , the time 
Trump was facing his huge debt. for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev. a Russain oligarch. 
That is, Trump had either miraculously earned $55 million, without putting up a dime, or 
Rybolovlev, or someone such as Rybolovlev, paid Trump Properties, LLC—actual owner 
unknown—$96 million, thereby providing a clean payment of $55 million to 
someone. This at the very same time that trump was into Deutsch bank for over 600 
million dollars but with a 40 millino personal guarnatee .Rybolovlev might have, in effect, 
paid himself for the house, thereby cleansing the money. Epstein, on his part, would be 
senetenced to 30 months, 12 of those months in jail on a prostitution charge. 
After the election, when Bannon was introduced to Epstein, Bannon told him, "You were 
the one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign." 
"not surprising" said Epstein.

1) I saw SB in London yesterday and he seemed especially paranoid about any reporters seeing me with him. 
My guess is that he is working hard on his relationship with Trump who he sees as newly ascendent and being 
seen with me might queer that. 
2) He went on Hannity last night and will be on Piers Morgan tomorrow and that seemed with an eye toward an 
audience of one. 
3) He was having a meeting yesterday with the French right wingers, including Le Pen's husband, about 
refinancing the National Front Party because apparently a good part of their money comes from Russia. Two 
thoughts here, these guys seemed like idiots, pure Ruritania, and Bannon, surrounded by his own thuggish-
looking security people and whacky-bloggers advisors, thrives precisely because the world of populism is so 
unprofessional (if not farcical).

"That Russian oligarch who spent that money on that property and never moved into it and ultimately tore it 
down, he's also a large shareholder in a bank called the Bank of Cyprus, which has been implicated in Russian 
money laundering. The chairman of the Bank of Cyprus is the former CEO of Deutsche Bank, to which Donald 
Trump owed all that money at the time he conveniently got this very large influx of cash from a Russian guy. 
The vice chairman of that bank until recently was our new secretary of commerce, long time Trump friend, 
Wilbur Ross.

Just spent two hours on the phone with Bannon. I saw Spicer and Priebus his week. I'd pretty much say that 
nearly 100% of the non-family senior staff of the first six months now believe that Trump can't function in this 
job. I think they all become part of a Republican initiative to take him down. I hear Kelly trying to make Trump 
understand that Jared and Ivanka have to go.

Salvator Mundi, the last known da Vinci painting in private hands, has an incredible 
provenance. Rybolovlev purchased it for $127 million in 2013 through his art dealer, the 
Swiss businessman Yves Bouvier. Bouvier, the owner and operator of several freeports, 
bought the painting for $80 million with the intention of selling it to Rybolovlev at a steep 
profit. Its owner before Bouvier, the New York City-based gallerist Robert Simon, found 
the painting at an estate auction in New Orleans in 2005. He paid just $10,000.

man, Donald Trump, raped her in 1994. We're planning to publish a story on the suit this afternoon, and we 
want to make sure it is fair. Is Mr. Epstein available to speak? Or do you want to offer a comment on this

Apparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira Rosen, a 60

Rosen also says he believes SB now weighing the strategy of making a formal and public break with

would look for some reporter to do a more nuanced post-morten on the case--with it's Trump overtones, legal

A few other follow ups: 
David and Brigid point out that reality tv doesn't cost anything because it is, as it sounds, very low budget. 
No writing , no special expertise or knowledge or research , no archival footage , no copyright clearance , no

So...I'm doing this Trump book for a pile of money and with so far quite a bit of cooperation from them 
(DT called me the other day and spent 45 minutes on the phone ranting and raving about the media--
alarming). I wonder if you could introduce me to Tom Barrack--just to say I'm a journalist who you know 
and trust, and that I'll follow up with a description of the project that I'm doing. Also, I'd love a 
reintroduction to Kathy Ruemmler. I need some off-the-record perspective on White House procedures. 
Are you in NYC soon?

Mr. Weinberg — 
I am a reporter with the ABC News investigative unit. We are gathering background research on the major 
candidates for President. 
Seeing that both former President Clinton and Mr. Trump have been mentioned in connection to the Jeffrey 
Epstein case, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that 
could help explain Mr. Epstein's dealings and interactions with both men. 
I would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation 
at your earliest convenience. 
Please let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet. 
Many thanks,

So...a couple of times a year somebody can cull the Internet and write an article about you that recycles every 
other article. That's a reason to try to create a new story. But, on the other hand, by not offering new news the 
old seems just ho-hum.

I think you should let him hang himself If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives 
you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive 
benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is 
possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political 
correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.

Dear Jeffrey, You mentioned you were friends with Tom Barrack and I wondered if you might introduce me to 
him. As discussed, I'm doing a book on the first 100 days of the Trump White House--POTUS and key staff 
know all about it and are cooperating--and would love to chat with Tom on or off the record. Thanks in advance 
and look forward to seeing you soon. All best, Michael

Mr. Weinberg — 
I am a reporter with the ABC News investigative unit. We are gathering background research on the major 
candidates for President. 
Seeing that both former President Clinton and Mr. Trump have been mentioned in connection to the Jeffrey 
Epstein case, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that 
could help explain Mr. Epstein's dealings and interactions with both men. 
I would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation at 
your earliest convenience. 
Please let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet. 
Many thanks, 
Matthew

Subject: Patterson
From: michael wolff
To: jeevacation@gmail.com
Direction: michael wolff → jeevacation@gmail.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be able 
to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a 
sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have 
some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you 
frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical 
proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the 
lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps 
some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, expensive 
effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely 
be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp 
up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered 
before. 
Meanwhile--
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's "authorship" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032244 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

The allegation: Harth claimed that Trump made repeated unwanted sexual advances as she and her romantic 
partner at the time, George Houraney, pursued a business relationship with the mogul in the early 1990s. She 
said that on January 24, 1993, at Mar-a-Lago, Trump offered her a tour of the estate, then pulled her into his 
daughter Ivanka's empty bedroom. 
"He pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again," Harth 
said, "and I had to physically say: 'What are you doing? Stop it.' It was a shocking thing to have him do this 
because he knew I was with George, he knew they were in the next room. And how could he be doing this when 
I'm there for business?" 
In 1997 Harth and Houraney sued Trump for breach of contract, and she filed a separate sexual-harassment suit, 
accusing him of "attempted rape." They reached a confidential settlement in the contract suit, and as part of the 
agreement Harth withdrew her suit.
