FBI Epstein files say he gave info. Does it 
explain sweetheart deal?

Uma Sanghvi WEST PALM BEACH 
Ten years after convicted Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein escaped federal charges 
in connection with allegations that he paid dozens of teenage girls for sex, the FBI last week 
released what appears to be an explosive explanation for what many have long described as 
a sweetheart deal. 
"Epstein has also provided information to the FBI as agreed upon," agents wrote in one of 
dozens of heavily redacted, decade-old memos that were unexpectedly and inexplicably 
posted on an FBI website known as "The Vault." 
The simple declaration stunned those who have been following the tortuous and celebrity-
studded case for years. It rekindled talk that the billionaire's 2008 decision to plead guilty to 
state charges to make the federal investigation disappear was part of a cover up to protect 
Epstein's high-powered friends, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill  
Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew. 
"That sentence obviously means something but I, too, am at a loss as to what it really 
means," said attorney Brad Edwards, who for a decade has been trying to unravel the 
mystery of Epstein's plea deal. "If there was some cooperation I would have expected that 
we would have been told. However, nothing surprises me at this point." 
In recent years, federal prosecutors have offered various explanations for why they agreed to 
drop the case they were building against the 65-year-old enigmatic money manager if he 
pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges. In court papers, they have said they wanted to 
get justice for Epstein's young victims but worried a jury wouldn't believe them. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028536 
So, they have said, they negotiated a deal, allowing Epstein to plead guilty in Palm Beach 
County Circuit Court to one count of soliciting a minor for prostitution and another charge 
of soliciting prostitution. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed to close their investigation. 
They have said they had no idea Epstein would only serve 13 months of an 18-month 
sentence in a vacant wing of the county stockade___a cell he was allowed to leave 16 hours 
a day, six days a week. 
While voicing dismay at his lax punishment, prosecutors have pointed out that the plea deal 
required Epstein to pay the roughly 30 young women who filed civil lawsuits against him. 
Further, they said his guilty pleas force him to register as a sex offender for the rest of his 
life, potentially protecting other girls from abuse in the future. 
However, over the years, they have never suggested that Epstein provided them any 
information in return. 
Like Edwards, two people close to the long-closed federal investigation said they were 
flummoxed by the sentence in the FBI's memo that was written in September 2008, roughly 
two months after Epstein pleaded guilty in state court. 
"I have never, ever heard of Jeffrey Epstein cooperating in any sense of the word," said one 
official, who requested anonymity because of the top role the person played in the 
investigation. "I am stumped. It's totally out of left field." 
Another individual with ties to the case voiced similar views. Epstein may have been 
required to talk to FBI agents but it's unlikely he offered anything that would incriminate 
others, said the person, who declined to be identified because of ongoing efforts to help 
Epstein's victims challenge the plea deal. "I don't think he ever told the truth," the person 
said. 
A lawsuit Edwards filed against the federal government, claiming prosecutors violated the 
Victims Rights Act by not notifying Epstein's victims of the pending plea deal, is still 
pending in U.S. District Court. Also, awaiting trial in Palm Beach County Circuit Court is a 
malicious prosecution lawsuit Edwards filed against Epstein. Edwards claims the billionaire 
filed a frivolous lawsuit to punish Edwards for representing a handful of Epstein's young 
victims. 
West Palm Beach attorney Jack Goldberger, who was on Epstein's potent defense team, said 
he was "unable to respond" to questions about the FBI's memo. Other prominent lawyers 
who represented Epstein, including New York lawyer Jay Lefkowitz and retired Harvard law 
professor Alan Dershowitz, didn't respond to requests for comment. 
The one line was part of a brief missive dated Sept. 18, 2008, closing the case: "On 9/11/08, 
case agent advised writer that Epstein is currently being prosecuted by the State of Florida 
and is complying with all conditions of his plea with the State of Florida. Epstein has also 
provided information to the FBI as agreed upon. Case agent advised that no federal 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028537 
prosecution will occur in this matter as long as Epstein continues to uphold his agreement 
with the State of Florida. ... Case agent is requested to contact writer in the event this matter 
moves forward on a federal level." 
The memo was one of hundreds of documents, including dozens of copies of newspaper 
articles about Epstein, that were posted on the FBI's website. The website, 
www.vaultibi.gov, serves as the FBI's electronic FOIA library. The heavily redacted 
documents showed agents traveled to New York City, Sante Fe, N.M., and St. Thomas in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein has homes. But there is little information about who they 
interviewed or what they learned. 
The only witness named in the documents is Alfredo Rodriguez, who was a houseman at 
Epstein's Palm Beach mansion in 2004. That's when Epstein regularly paid young women to 
give him sexually-charged massages, police said. 
Rodriguez was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2010 and sentenced to 18 months in jail 
for trying to sell a journal he purloined from Epstein. Prosecutors said the journal detailed 
Epstein's sexual dalliances. Rodriguez, who lived in Kendall, died in 2014. 
Those familiar with FBI procedures said the records are administrative files, not 
investigative ones. Some questioned why the files were posted on the FBI's web site. The 
FBI didn't return a phone call for comment. According to the web site, the records were 
released "in compliance with the National Archives and Records Administration 
requirements." 
And while it's been 10 years since Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges and settled 
dozens of lawsuits with young women, litigation continues.

Dear Mr. Link: 
A transcript made public today show how Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team fought for and ultimately won a broad protective 
order in the lawsuit filed by accuser Sarah Ransome against your client Jeffrey Epstein. It also shows the Maxwell legal 
team's concern about the media coverage, especially from the Miami Herald, weeks before it published today's bombshell 
investigation today. 
My questions are: 
What is your response to the Miami Herald story published today? 
How would you respond to the series' allegations that there has been a more than decade-long cover-up of Epstein and 
his powerful associates, including by Trump's current secretary of labor Alexander Acosta? 
Please reply ASAP as I am on deadline.

R REPRINT OF THIS STORY 
Just days before a Friday deadline, the Justice Department has reassigned the Jeffrey Epstein victims' rights 
case to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta, the attorneys representing Epstein's victims' attorneys said 
Tuesday. 
Miami federal prosecutors, in letter to attorneys for the victims's lawyers on Monday, said they had recused 
themselves from the case, according to Brad Edwards and Jack Scarola, representing Epstein's victims. 
'Mar. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031384 
The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, Byung J. "BJay" Pak, will 
oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta's chief federal 
prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017. 
The Justice Department is still under a Friday deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims' attorneys in 
an effort to settle the case. On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra in Palm Beach ruled that federal 
prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke the law when they concealed a plea 
agreement from more than 30 underage girls in Palm Beach who had been sexually abused by Epstein, a 
multimillionaire New York hedge fund manager. 
Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted Epstein and an untold number of accomplices 
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided Epstein plead guilty to minor charges in 
state court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against Epstein to 
write a 53-page federal indictment, court records show.

An investigation by the Miami Herald, "Perversion of Justice," found that after Acosta met privately with one 
of Epstein's lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not 
even the state court judge who sentenced Epstein — would know the full extent of his crimes. Epstein, now 66, 
was allowed to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where 
he was given liberal work release, and allowed to travel to New York and his private island in the Caribbean 
during his subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between New York, 
Palm Beach and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
The Herald interviewed four of Epstein's victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by 
Epstein. They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead 
of victims. Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which 
grants crime victims the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors. 
Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, but 
they misled the girls into believing that the FBI's sex trafficking case against Epstein was ongoing — when, in 
fact, prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record. 
Marra, noting that he reviewed affidavits, depositions and interrogatories, said "Epstein worked in concert with 
others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031385 
The victims' attorneys — Edwards, Scarola and Paul Cassell — have asked the Justice Department to throw out 
Epstein's plea agreement and reopen the criminal investigation. 
Edwards, who brought the victims' rights case against the government, said transferring the case to another 
jurisdiction is a prudent decision. 
"I think it's good that we're going to get fresh eyes and a fresh opinion on the way the case was handled," 
Edwards said Tuesday. "We were obviously in an adversarial posture with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami 
because they handled the case to begin with." 
Miami's new U.S. Attorney, Ariana Fajardo Orshan — who was appointed by President Trump in September 
— did not respond to a request for comment.

Edwards predicted that it would take some time for Pak's office to review the case, which includes more than 
500 docket entries and thousands of documents. He said If the sides can't agree on a resolution, then Marra 
would likely have to come up with one. The case is being closely watched by crime victims' rights advocates, 
as it will likely set a precedent. 
Acosta, who was appointed by Trump as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017, is the focus of a separate Justice 
Department investigation into whether there was any prosecutorial misconduct in the Epstein case. That probe, 
by the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility, was initiated in response to demands from a bipartisan 
group in Congress, led by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz of Florida. 
In the meantime, a court hearing will be held at 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York in another Epstein-related case. 
A federal appeals court will hear oral arguments in a motion by the Miami Herald, supported by 32 other news 
organizations, asking the court to unseal documents that could reveal details about the extent of Epstein's 
crimes and any other people who may have been involved. 
Three of Epstein's former attorneys — who helped negotiate his plea deal in 2008 — wrote a letter published in 
the New York Times on Monday, defending the plea bargain cut with Acosta as a fair deal. The letter was in 
response to a Times editorial that called on Congress and the Trump administration to hold Acosta and others 
involved in the case accountable. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031386 
Epstein's lawyers said the editorial's conclusions were "in profound conflict with the reality," noting that there 
was no evidence that Epstein committed federal sex trafficking offenses. The letter was signed by former 
Epstein lawyers Kenneth Starr, Jack Goldberger and Lilly Ann Sanchez, as well as Epstein's current attorney, 
Martin G. Weinberg.
