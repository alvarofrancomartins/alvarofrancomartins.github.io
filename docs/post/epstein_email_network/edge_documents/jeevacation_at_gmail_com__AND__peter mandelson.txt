Ben and Lord Mandelson: 
My late reply does no justice to my enthusiasm to follow up on our previous call and to your interest in the same. Apologies. 
A word of explanation about the past two weeks: 
• Financing: 
Am in the midst of a $8-10 mn financing 
In past two weeks have met potential investors in Toronto, Vancouver, DC, NYC, and Boston. 
Have in this time already closed approximately $2 mn, which is encouraging 
This pace will continue for another month or so until the financing is fully closed. 
• US DoD: 
Last week several of us took our prototype device to be demonstrated for the US military's Walter Reed Army Institute of 
Research (WRAIR). 
At the conclusion of a four-hour session our host, Colonel Colin Ohrt, MD, who is in charge of the relevant WRAIR program, 
called our device a game-changer. He would like to pilot our device in Tanzania, Cambodia, Kenya, and Thailand. Follow up is 
being arranged. 
Colonel Ohrt also separately evaluated our white paper on malaria elimination and expressed strong interest in also pursuing this 
project with Fio. 
Accompanying Fio for these meetings was General Richard Tubb, MD (retired last year from the US Air Force). Dick was Chief 
of the White House Medical Unit and physician to Presidents Clinton and Bush. 
• USAID 
Also last week we successfully demonstrated our device for USAID and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). Follow up is 
being arranged. 
Accompanying Fio for these meetings was Andrew Natsios, former head of USAID. 
For all the foregoing meetings our prototype device performed well. Exciting times. 
My trip to London has yet to be arranged and is dependent on financing events. In the meantime, I will happily travel to meet you 
in NYC. 
Attached is the White Paper on Malaria Elimination which Fio had written and invited several academic partners to join. Since the 
time the document was first drafted, we discovered an even simpler technical strategy based on our new prototype device and 
reinforced by our recent discussion with WRAIR. This simplification would result in field trials as early as next year, which is 
much sooner than in the attached White Paper. To accomplish this we would team up with WRAIR rather than some of the current 
academic partners in the paper. 
Best regards and wishes,

PS: Ben, any emails I've sent to Lord Mandelson always bounced back. Clearly I don't have the correct email address. Kindly

Michael, 
Thanks for your time on Friday, it was great to hear more about FIO, we are keen to hear more. 
In terms of follow up 
- we look forward to receiving the White Paper that you mentioned. 
- we will consider opportunities in Russia, principally via Rusnano, who we are in discussions 
with http://www.rusnano.com/Home.aspx?dummy=634236281106041875  
- you asked about Onexim, this is the principal investment vehicle for Prokhorov (think New Jersey 
Nets). He's reckoned to be the wealthiest man in Russia post-crisis. He is investing more in nanotech and 
green energy projects. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029915 
- London meeting - please let us know dates when you might be coming through Europe. 
- NY meeting - we will update when we know more about plans to come to New York as we could also aim 
to meet there. 
Let's keep in touch and see where we get. 
Best 
Ben

I am writing in an attempt to make contact with Jeffrey Epstein and wondered if you would, as his attorney, 
forward this message on to him? 
We are keen to explore the possibility of conducting an interview with Mr Epstein, on the subject of the stories 
which are circulating, however inaccurately, about both him and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; we'd be 
keen to hear from Mr Epstein first hand so that the various and at times, speculative reporting which is at large 
in the UK press can be better scrutinised? 
Let me tell you a bit about the Today programme. 
Today is the BBC's main morning news show; we have been part of the BBC for over 50 years and are generally 
considered one of the most important news broadcast outlets - either on radio or TV - here in the UK. We set the 
news agenda for the BBC and in many respects we set the daily news agenda for the country. Our interviews 
are regularly re broadcast across the BBC's national and international news network including - BBC World, 
BBC World Service and BBC Online. The combination of these outlets means the global 'reach' of a BBC 
Today programme interview is second to none. 
Programme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international 
relations and the arts including US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, President Nicholas Sarkozy, President 
Hamid Karzai, HRH the Prince of Wales, former President Musharraf, former Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice, former President Bill Clinton, Senator George Mitchell, Al Gore, Kofi Annan, former Prime Minister 
Tony Blair, the Dalai Lama, Bill Gates, George Soros, Stephen Hawking, Sir Paul McCartney, Mick Jaggar 
and Salman Rushdie. 
We are a programme that carries considerable weight and influence and which prides itself in being a first port 
of call for many of the most important and influential figures on the international stage. 
I can best be reached via my cell phone -_______________________1- or this email address. 
My very best wishes and my thanks!
