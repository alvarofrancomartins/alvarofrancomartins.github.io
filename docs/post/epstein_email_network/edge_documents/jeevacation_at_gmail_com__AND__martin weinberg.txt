Margie, 
IT As you know, nothing too big or too small for us, especially in the summer IT Hmmmmm. I have to be 
direct -- you or someone at your paper was very astute in checking the Clerk and Comptroller's computer 
and activity in the Epstein case two days before the hearing. As result, you sent me a text message on 
Saturday asking what the activity was about and I confirmed that the plea would take place. You were 
the only member of the news media that I talked with. And yet, after the case is completely over, the 
Palm Beach Daily News' editorial staff remains silent on the topic. 
Thanks,

Two years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey Epstein 
finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 million, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for 
sex. A week ago, the 55-year-old investment banker began serving 18 months in jail. 
But that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for 
prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually 
abused them. And why is Epstein serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state 
prison, where inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year? 
The slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public that there's a different system of 
justice for the wealthy who hire high-powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense 
attorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended O.J. Simpson 
against murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying 
about sex with young women. 
Palm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry Krischer sent the case to 
a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once boasted of accepting only billionaire clients 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021761 
could face a trial. The police had taken a high school transcript, class schedules and phone messages from 
Epstein's home that showed he knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's 
lawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls' character by showing they had chatted on myspace.com about 
smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide whether the victims - and Epstein - were 
credible. 
Ultimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the plea agreement left 
Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein had been convicted at a trial, he could 
have been sentenced to anything from probation to 15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna 
Belohlavek said, adding that the recommended guideline sentence was 21 months. 
Epstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically required of sex 
offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court supervision, who will ensure Epstein is in 
fact being treated? 
The plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was warranted, how does 
dropping it before completion benefit the public? 
Epstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his lawyers bought him 
the protection the state attorney owed to the victims. 
Police chief's reputation helps discredit attacks

In the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are accused of 
wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter. 
Epstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution solely because of Reiter's 
"craziness," one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department disseminated "a distorted view of the case" and 
behaved in a "childish" manner when the grand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another 
Epstein lawyer complained. To hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the 
sheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce. 
Reiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, Jill, last year, after 24 years of marriage. They have a son, 18, 
and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go to mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file 
suggests their split is particularly ugly. 
Reiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney's office for two reasons. First, he 
pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of sexual activity with minors. Second, he 
slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt language seldom used by one law-enforcement official 
concerning another because of what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case. 
In a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case "highly unusual." He added, 
"I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the 
prosecution of these cases." 
In short, Reiter told the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. "It looks 
like a departure from professionalism," Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said of 
Reiter's letter. 
Following Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether the super-rich, super-
connected defendant had violated any federal laws. 
Reiter won't discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one word to 
describe the chief: professional. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021762 
"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership," said Rick Lincoln, chief of the 
Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 years. 
"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all consider Mike to be our peer and a 
man of integrity." 
Juno Beach Police Chief H.C. Clark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on 
countywide law enforcement issues. "I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen anything but a 
professional demeanor from him." 
Reiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol job at the University 
of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job evaluations. 
Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a resident confined to his home with a 
sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. 
Another resident thanked Reiter for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have 
been at fault. 
Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. And he's no novice at 
investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the lead detective probing the drug overdose 
death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was one of the officers who worked the investigation of William 
Kennedy Smith, who was charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy 
family compound in Palm Beach. 
Reiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University, also 
has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and management courses at Harvard. He's been 
active in countywide interagency law enforcement organizations and has a "top secret" national security 
clearance. 
"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town," said Town Manager Peter 
Elwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes more than $144,000 as 
the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it. 
"He's very businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the work," 
Elwell said. "I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus years."

• Darren Indyke [1111111111111.1111111111, 
Here are some questions. Thanks again for your help! Would love to talk to him, or travel to meet with him if that would be possible. 
-What is he chiefly focusing on now? Is he spending more time on The Jeffrey Epstein Science Foundation? Could he talk about his 
interest in science and the 2011 grants/conference? 
-How has his business been affected? Is there any new direction he's taking it? Does he still have the same clients or new ones? Is it 
still at $15 billion? 
-Did he still work while in prison? How was that arranged? With whom was he working/advising? 
-Where is he spending his time now? How has his social life changed from three years ago? 
-Is he still close with Ghislaine Maxwell? Someone said she lives with him (but that doesn't sound right)? 
-What were friends/colleagues/acquaintances reactions to his conviction? 
-What does he think about the sentence he got- was it too lenient or too harsh and why? 
-What is his side of the story and have people been supportive? 
-Is he continuing the charity initiatives he started with Bill Clinton, etc?

Swiss Accounts Survey 
Dear Mr Epstein, 
We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in 
London, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present. 
It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and 
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. 
There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, UK 
domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money. 
We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts 
contained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include: 
HSBC (Suisse) SA 
FAMILY INTEREST L.P. 
22079 
BESSIE 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
1) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money. 
We will be particularly concerned with these questions: 
2) Why you had Swiss accounts. 
3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. 
Additionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that: 
4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were 
sentenced to 18 months in prison. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030336 
5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr Leslie Wexner. 
6) You are known to be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and 
Kevin Spacey. 
7) You have made substantial contributions to the Clintons' philanthropic causes. Tax reform campaigners 
have previously been critical of those who engage in public life or the political process while avoiding or 
evading tax. Hilary Clinton herself, speaking in 2012, noted the importance of elites paying a substantial share 
of tax: "One of the issues that I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an equitable 
manner — especially from the elites in every country." 
It is intended shortly to publish the results of our survey in both the US and the UK. 
As responsible journalists acting in the public interest, we would first like to give you the opportunity to 
comment. 
If we do not hear from you by 18:00 on Monday 12th January 2015 (preferably by email to 
we shall proceed on the basis that you do not wish to comment on or amend 
our information. 
But we have approached you in a straightforward fashion and hope you will take this opportunity to respond if 
you wish. Your substantive responses to each of our numbered points will be carefully considered and 
published if appropriate. 
(For the avoidance of doubt, we do not normally regard any generalised assertion of "inaccuracies" as a 
substantive response; nor any generalised statement that the holders acted on advice. Neither will we regard as 
substantive any comment that only refers to the present state of affairs and not to the past.) 
We are, of course, happy to discuss directly any concerns you may have. 
We would be most grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter. This will save us from chasing.

3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. 
Additionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that: 
4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were 
sentenced to 18 months in prison. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030597 
5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr Leslie Wexner. 
6) You are known to be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and 
Kevin Spacey. 
7) You have made substantial contributions to the Clintons' philanthropic causes. Tax reform campaigners 
have previously been critical of those who engage in public life or the political process while avoiding or 
evading tax. Hilary Clinton herself, speaking in 2012, noted the importance of elites paying a substantial share 
of tax: "One of the issues that I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an equitable 
manner — especially from the elites in every country." 
It is intended shortly to publish the results of our survey in both the US and the UK. 
As responsible journalists acting in the public interest, we would first like to give you the opportunity to 
comment. 
If we do not hear from you by 18:00 on Monday 12th January 2015 (preferably by email to 
_________________, we shall proceed on the basis that you do not wish to comment on or amend 
our information. 
But we have approached you in a straightforward fashion and hope you will take this opportunity to respond if 
you wish. Your substantive responses to each of our numbered points will be carefully considered and 
published if appropriate. 
(For the avoidance of doubt, we do not normally regard any generalised assertion of "inaccuracies" as a 
substantive response; nor any generalised statement that the holders acted on advice. Neither will we regard as 
substantive any comment that only refers to the present state of affairs and not to the past.) 
We are, of course, happy to discuss directly any concerns you may have. 
We would be most grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter. This will save us from chasing.

Swiss Accounts Survey 
Dear Mr Epstein, 
We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in 
London, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present. 
It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and 
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. 
There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, 
UK domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money. 
We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts 
contained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include: 
HSBC (Suisse) SA 
FAMILY INTEREST L.P. 
22079

Good Afternoon Mr. Dershowitz, 
I'm John Sullivan, a reporter at The Washington Post. I've been reading with great interest stories 
about allegations that former President Clinton spent time on Jeffrey Epstein's Caribbean Island. In a 
declaration you filled in federal court you state that you have reason to believe this is not true. Are 
you available to discuss this with me? Thank you for your time.

Subject: Meet? 
Mr. Weinberg — 
I am a reporter with the ABC News investigative unit. We are gathering background research on the major candidates 
for President. 
Seeing that both former President Clinton and Mr. Trump have been mentioned in connection to the Jeffrey Epstein 
case, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that could help explain 
Mr. Epstein's dealings and interactions with both men. 
I would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation at your 
earliest convenience. 
Please let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet. 
Many thanks, 
Matthew

To: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> 
A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be 
able to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In 
a sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I 
have some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting 
you frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and 
technical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something 
along the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and 
perhaps some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, 
expensive effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll 
surely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032250 
amp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've 
encountered before. 
Meanwhile--
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's "authorship" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

Thank you Marty, 
The questions we wanted to reach out to Mr Epstein for comment are listed below. Feel free to contact me on 
fter reviewing. Kind regards - Matt 
A former employee has told us that Donald Trump attended Mr Epstein's Palm Beach estate on at least two occasions. Does Mr 
Epstein recall hosting Donald Trump at that residence? 
On one such occasion, it has been suggested to us that Mr Epstein and Donald Trump watched "young girls try on bikinis" while making 
comments on the their bodies." Does Mr Epstein have any comment? 
How does Mr Epstein respond to claims that women - some under the legal age of sexual consent - were used as "sex slaves" at his 
properties? 
A former employee of Mr Epstein has alleged to us that Mr Epstein sexually assaulted her on 
numerous occasions. Does Mr Epstein have a comment? 
Did or does Mr Epstein have cameras inside rooms at his Palm Beach residence? 
Did Mr Epstein remove those cameras before police raided the property as part of the investigation into alleged crimes? Did Mr Epstein 
ever hand over any recordings from any cameras at his properties to the authorities as part of his non-prosecution agreement? 
Does Mr Epstein have in his possession any video recordings of Donald Trump taken from inside his Palm Beach estate or any other 
residence? 
Did Mr Epstein hold sex parties at his residences involving girls under the age of sexual consent? Was Donald Trump ever present at 
any of these parties? 
Has Mr Epstein upheld the conditions of his sentencing and registered as a sex offender in all jurisdictions in which he is due to do so? 
Does Mr Epstein have any comment regarding allegations made by a woman named in the media as Virginia Giuffre/Roberts relating to 
her being sexually abused by Mr Epstein or used as a "sex slave"?

Just days before a Friday deadline, the Justice Department has reassigned the Jeffrey Epstein victims' rights 
case to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta, the attorneys representing Epstein's victims' attorneys said 
Tuesday. 
Miami federal prosecutors, in letter to attorneys for the victims's lawyers on Monday, said they had recused 
themselves from the case, according to Brad Edwards and Jack Scarola, representing Epstein's victims.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031384 
The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, Byung J. "BJay" Pak, will 
oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta's chief federal 
prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017. 
The Justice Department is still under a Friday deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims' attorneys in 
an effort to settle the case. On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra in Palm Beach ruled that federal 
prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke the law when they concealed a plea 
agreement from more than 30 underage girls in Palm Beach who had been sexually abused by Epstein, a 
multimillionaire New York hedge fund manager. 
Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted Epstein and an untold number of accomplices 
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided Epstein plead guilty to minor charges in 
state court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against Epstein to 
write a 53-page federal indictment, court records show.

An investigation by the Miami Herald, "Perversion of Justice," found that after Acosta met privately with one 
of Epstein's lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not 
even the state court judge who sentenced Epstein — would know the full extent of his crimes. Epstein, now 66, 
was allowed to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where 
he was given liberal work release, and allowed to travel to New York and his private island in the Caribbean 
during his subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between New York, 
Palm Beach and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
The Herald interviewed four of Epstein's victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by 
Epstein. They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead 
of victims. Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which 
grants crime victims the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors. 
Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, but 
they misled the girls into believing that the FBI's sex trafficking case against Epstein was ongoing — when, in 
fact, prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record. 
Marra, noting that he reviewed affidavits, depositions and interrogatories, said "Epstein worked in concert with 
others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031385 
The victims' attorneys — Edwards, Scarola and Paul Cassell — have asked the Justice Department to throw out 
Epstein's plea agreement and reopen the criminal investigation. 
Edwards, who brought the victims' rights case against the government, said transferring the case to another 
jurisdiction is a prudent decision. 
"I think it's good that we're going to get fresh eyes and a fresh opinion on the way the case was handled," 
Edwards said Tuesday. "We were obviously in an adversarial posture with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami 
because they handled the case to begin with." 
Miami's new U.S. Attorney, Ariana Fajardo Orshan — who was appointed by President Trump in September 
— did not respond to a request for comment.

Edwards predicted that it would take some time for Pak's office to review the case, which includes more than 
500 docket entries and thousands of documents. He said If the sides can't agree on a resolution, then Marra 
would likely have to come up with one. The case is being closely watched by crime victims' rights advocates, 
as it will likely set a precedent. 
Acosta, who was appointed by Trump as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017, is the focus of a separate Justice 
Department investigation into whether there was any prosecutorial misconduct in the Epstein case. That probe, 
by the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility, was initiated in response to demands from a bipartisan 
group in Congress, led by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz of Florida. 
In the meantime, a court hearing will be held at 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York in another Epstein-related case. 
A federal appeals court will hear oral arguments in a motion by the Miami Herald, supported by 32 other news 
organizations, asking the court to unseal documents that could reveal details about the extent of Epstein's 
crimes and any other people who may have been involved. 
Three of Epstein's former attorneys — who helped negotiate his plea deal in 2008 — wrote a letter published in 
the New York Times on Monday, defending the plea bargain cut with Acosta as a fair deal. The letter was in 
response to a Times editorial that called on Congress and the Trump administration to hold Acosta and others 
involved in the case accountable. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031386 
Epstein's lawyers said the editorial's conclusions were "in profound conflict with the reality," noting that there 
was no evidence that Epstein committed federal sex trafficking offenses. The letter was signed by former 
Epstein lawyers Kenneth Starr, Jack Goldberger and Lilly Ann Sanchez, as well as Epstein's current attorney, 
Martin G. Weinberg.

Jeffrey Epstein prosecutor was 
previously rebuked for handling of a 
child sex case 
Julie K. Brown 
Nine months before cutting a covert plea deal with sex trafficking suspect Jeffrey 
Epstein, Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was notified that the lead 
prosecutor in Epstein's case had concealed victim information in another underage 
sex crimes case, the Miami Herald has learned. 
The prosecutor, A. Marie Villafaria, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in 
January 2007 for what he called her "intentional and/or serious lapse in judgment" 
when she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who 
traveled to Florida to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, had a prior history of 
predatory behavior with minors, court records show. 
Acosta, her boss at the time, not only knew about Villafaria's breach — records show 
that he subsequently defended it. Acosta assigned another prosecutor in his office to 
write a treatise for the judge in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to soften 
the stinging language in his order. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021729 
Senior U.S. District Court Judge William J. Zloch copied Acosta on his order, 
noting, "The court is at a total loss as to why the Office of the United States Attorney 
for the Southern District of Florida, as well as the Assistant United States Attorney 
assigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold ... 
information from the court." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021730 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021731 
A. Marie Villafaria was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney's office's handling of 
the prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized. 
Later that year, Acosta and Villafaria put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a 
multimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage 
girls at his mansion in Palm Beach. The deal, a federal judge ruled last month, was 
intentionally kept from his victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
While the two cases are unrelated, it shows that both Acosta and Villafaria had been 
warned about the importance of victim disclosure in sex crimes cases before the 
Epstein agreement. They nevertheless forged ahead with a pact with Epstein that 
violated the law. 
U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra wrote: "When the Government gives 
information to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold 
hours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein's 
attorneys, scant information was shared with victims." 
This comes as Acosta, who is now the U.S. secretary of labor, is facing mounting 
scrutiny for his oversight of the Epstein case. On Monday, White House press 
secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether President Trump has full 
confidence in Acosta, noting that Acosta's involvement in the Epstein case is 
GG 
currently under review." 
The Justice Department launched a probe in January into whether Acosta, Villafaria 
and other prosecutors committed professional misconduct. 
Francey Hakes, who worked in the Justice Department's Crimes Against Children 
unit, said Zloch's comments were so brutal that it should have deterred Acosta and 
Villafaria from keeping the deal secret. 
"It is highly unusual for a court to allege an assistant U.S. attorney has intentionally 
withheld information. That allegation is like dropping a bomb in the legal 
community," she said. 
The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender's remarkable deal 
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. 
"It seems to show that they are not taking these cases very seriously, they are not 
advocating for strong punishment for sexual predators, and not advocating for 
victims in a meaningful way." 
Villafaria, a well-regarded 18-year veteran federal prosecutor, would not comment 
for this story. But her lawyer, Jonathan Biran, said she has worked tirelessly on 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021732 
behalf of crime victims. She received the 2011 National Crime Victims' Rights 
Service Award as well as the Attorney General's Project Safe Childhood Award. 
He also pointed out that the parents of the victim in the Texas man's case wrote a 
letter thanking Villafaria at the conclusion of the case. 
"AUSA Villafaria has spent her 18-year career advocating tirelessly on behalf of 
victims of some of the most serious crimes in Florida, and has received numerous 
awards for her successful prosecution of major cases," Biran said, adding that 
Villafaria has "made South Florida a safer place for children and adults alike." 
Enticing a minor 
By all accounts, Adam McDaniel was an awkward and shy Texas teenager who spent 
countless hours on his computer, socializing with girls on the internet. 
In 2005, McDaniel, then 19, traveled from Texas to Fort Lauderdale, where he 
hopped into a taxi and headed to Boca Raton to meet up with a 14-year-old girl he 
had been talking to online for about a year. He picked up the ninth grader at a high 
school basketball game, and drove her to a Marriott, hotel where they spent the 
night, court records show. 
When she failed to come home that evening, her parents called Boca Raton police. 
Officers tracked the pair down at the hotel the next day, where they found them in 
bed, clad in little more than their underwear, according to court records. 
McDaniel was arrested on federal sex charges, and pleaded guilty on Oct. 6, 2006, to 
enticing a minor into sexual conduct by means of interstate commerce, which 
carried a sentence of from five years up to 30 years in federal prison. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021733 
U.S. District Judge William Zloch 
At sentencing, McDaniel's public defender, Patrick Hunt, argued for a reduced 
sentence, blaming his client's immaturity for the crime. McDaniel had been a good 
student at Texas Tech and had a family that supported him, Hunt told Zloch. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021734 
Family and acquaintances, including a former Fort Worth police lieutenant, 
submitted letters to the court vouching for McDaniel's character. 
There were other issues, however, presented to the judge. While McDaniel was 
being held in federal lockup awaiting sentencing, he had corresponded with his 
victim, despite being ordered not to contact her, the court record shows. 
Still, Hunt argued that a sentence of five years was overly harsh. 
Villafaria disagreed, but conceded that McDaniel would benefit from psychological 
treatment. She advocated for a sentence of five to sex years, which was at the low 
end of the guideline. 
It was then that the judge heard from the victim's mother. 
In a statement, the mother decried the emotional and mental trauma her daughter 
suffered and the long road to recovery she had ahead of her. The mother mentioned 
she was further upset that McDaniel continued contact with her daughter after his 
arrest and she said she believed that McDaniel was still trying to manipulate her 
daughter by blaming her for his arrest. 
The mother pointed out that prior to their sexual encounter, McDaniel had directed 
her daughter to watch sexually explicit movies and had described for her sex 
activities he had had with another underage girl. 
At that point, the judge interrupted. 
"...There has been some reference to another incident with a minor girl. What do 
you know about that, if anything?" Zloch asked Villafaria.

deal for Jeffrey Epstein.

Only then did Zloch learn that McDaniel had preyed on other girls over the internet, 
including a 16-year-old California girl whom he brought to Texas and impregnated. 
He was also having another relationship with a 15-year-old girl at the time of his 
arrest, Villafaria admitted in court. 
The judge promptly sentenced McDaniel to 10 years — twice what Villafaria 
recommended. 
Three months later, in January 2007, after reviewing the entire case, Zloch issued 
an order excoriating Villafaria for failing to tell him about McDaniel's prior history. 
"The serial nature of defendant's seduction of minor girls was revealed for the first 
time to the court upon the Government's response to the Court's inquiry," Zloch 
wrote, explaining that the defendant's past was evidence of predatory behavior that 
warranted a harsher sentence because he may pose a danger to the community. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lourie was assigned to try to correct the record and 
persuade the judge to strike a portion of his comments. They argued that since 
McDaniel had never before been charged with a crime, the history was not relevant 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021736 
at sentencing. The defendant's prior relationship with a 16-year-old was not illegal 
in Texas or in California, they said, and the girl classified her relationship as a 
friendship. 
All the relevant information was provided to the probation department and at 
McDaniel's detention hearing, they added, making the point that it was in the record 
and therefore, not intentionally withheld by the government. 
While Zloch conceded that the information was part of the probation and bond 
hearing record, he said it was nevertheless the U.S. Attorney's Office's duty to 
present the defendant's prior history with minors at sentencing. He refused to strike 
the most critical portions of his order. 
"Lack of candor to the court is a serious charge, and the judge has quite reasonably 
expressed dismay that the assistant U.S. attorney apparently intended that he never 
be given a full picture of the defendant's conduct," Hakes said. 
But nine months later, in September 2007, Villafaria was in the throes of thorny 
negotiations with Epstein's lawyers. While an FBI investigation was ongoing, 
Villafaria discussed ways to quietly resolve the case, emails show. 
A Miami Herald investigation, -Perversion of Justice," published in November, 
revealed how federal prosecutors, including Acosta and Villafaria, tried to keep the 
full scope of Epstein's crimes out of the public eye. At one point, they discussed 
charging Epstein in Miami, instead of Palm Beach where the crimes happened, 
noting there would be less media coverage. 
Emails also show that prosecutors repeatedly abided by Epstein's lawyers' demands 
that his victims not be told that an agreement had been reached until after he was 
sentenced. That meant that the girls could not appear at the hearing to derail the 
deal. Prosecutors had drafted a 53-page federal indictment on sex trafficking 
charges, but Acosta instead allowed Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution 
charges in state court. In exchange, Epstein and his co-conspirators were given 
federal immunity. 
Villafaria wrote Epstein's lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, to discuss the wording of the 
sentencing agreement for the judge: 
"I will include all our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and 
I will mention co-conspirators, but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of 
the other crimes and all the other persons we could charge," Villafaria wrote. 
At Epstein's sentencing, assistant Palm Beach prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek was 
questioned by the judge about whether all of Epstein's victims were told about the 
deal, as required by law. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021737 
"Are there more than one victim?" Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo asked 
Belohlavek at the June 30, 2008 sentencing. 
"There's several," Belohlavek replied. 
"Are all the victims in both these cases in agreement with the terms of the plea?" the 
judge asked. 
"Yes," Belohlavek said. 
Coincidentally, the lawyer representing one of the victims was in the courtroom that 
day. He told the Herald that neither he, nor his client, was told about the agreement. 
Acosta has not responded to the Herald's repeated requests for comment. A 
spokesman at the Labor Department told the Washington Post last month: "The 
office's decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed 
departmental procedures." 
In the past, Acosta has said that he believed the deal was the best chance 
prosecutors had of ensuring that Epstein spent some time behind bars and was 
required to register as a sex offender. Epstein served 13 months in the Palm Beach 
County jail — but he was allowed to leave for up to 12 hours a day as part of a work 
release program not normally offered to convicted sex offenders. 
Epstein's victims, now in their late 20S and 30s, are fighting to have his deal 
overturned and Epstein sent to prison. 
Bradley Edwards, who represents several of Epstein's victims, defended Villafaria, 
saying he believed that she was directed to settle the case and not inform Epstein's 
victims about the deal. 
"In my conversations with her, I came to believe that she was in a difficult position. 
She never came out and said this, but I suspected that someone above her directed 
her to do what she did," Edwards said.

Congratulations to the 2019 Hillman Prize recipients! 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021113 
Sidney Hillman Foundation Names Winners of 2019 Prizes 
for Journalism in Service of the Common Good 
Reuters, NBC News and MSNBC, ProPublica Receive Honors; Adam Serwer to 
receive Opinion & Analysis Prize 
NEW YORK — The Sidney Hillman Foundation announced Tuesday winners of the 69th annual 
Hillman Prizes, recognizing a Reuters expose of slum-like living conditions on U.S military 
bases, the Miami Herald's investigation into Labor Secretary Alex Acosta's sweetheart deal with 
serial sex abuser, Jeffrey Epstein, and NBC News and MSNBC's reporting on the Trump 
Administration's family separation policy, among other standout reporting in service of the 
common good. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021114 
Hannah Dreier of ProPublica won a Hillman Prize for reporting that showed how the 
government's bungled crackdown on MS-13 has torn apart the lives of Latino immigrants. The 
Atlantic's Adam Serwer, who has emerged as a defining voice of the Trump era, won for his 
essays on racism and Trump's political movement, and Anna Clark won for her book on the 
Flint water crisis. 
This year's prizes were judged by writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, the New Yorker's Jelani Cobb, 
Reuters' Alb( Freedman, the New Yorker's Hendrik Hertzberg, the American Prospect's Harold 
Meyerson and The Nation's Katrina vanden Heuvel. 
The 2019 winners of the Hillman Prizes are: 
• Newspaper — Miami Herald, Julie K. Brown and Emily Michot: Perversion of Justice 
• Magazine — ProPublica with New York magazine, Newsday, This American Life, New 
York Times Magazine, Hannah Dreier: Trapped in Gangland 
• Web — Reuters, Joshua Schneyer, Michael Pell, Andrea Januta, Deborah Nelson: 
Ambushed at Home 
• Broadcast — NBC News and MSNBC, Jacob Soboroff and Julia Ainsley: Torn Apart: 
Crisis at the Border 
• Opinion & Analysis — Adam Serwer, The Atlantic 
• Book — Anna Clark: The Poisoned City: Flint's Water and the American Urban 
Tragedy, Metropolitan Books 
Reporting by this year's prize winners has had significant positive impact, including: 
• Reversal of the Trump administration's "Zero Tolerance" family separation policy 
• Three federal investigations, new legislation, widespread repairs, and a $386 million 
emergency program to inspect military housing for hazards 
• The exposure of pervasive bias and negligence by Long Island police, leading to federal 
and local investigations and reforms 
This year's honorees follow in the trailblazing tradition of past winners ranging from Murray 
Kempton in 1950 for his articles on labor in the south and Edward R. Murrow in 1954 for his 
critical reports on civil liberties and Joseph McCarthy at the height of the Red Scare; to 2017 
newspaper winner, David Fahrenthold, for exposing Donald Trump's sexual harassment and 
mismanagement of his foundation. 
The Hillman Prizes are open to journalists and subjects globally for any work widely accessible 
to a U.S. audience. Winners will be awarded a $5,000 prize at the Hillman Foundation's annual 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021115 
ceremony in New York City on May 7. 
"In a time when this country's highest powers have taken it as their business to demean the 
work of journalists, it is particularly significant for us to honor those who have taken up the 
tools of journalism to challenge corrupt power wherever it may reside," said Hillman judge Ta-
Nehisi Coates. 
In 2011, the Sidney Hillman Foundation inaugurated the Canadian Hillman Prize. This year's 
winners, Harvey Cashore, Bob McKeown and Kimberly Ivany of CBC's The Fifth Estate, won for 
their sweeping investigation into the research and regulatory failures that have put millions of 
children at risk on their way to and from school each day. Their reporting exposed fraudulent 
science behind Transport Canada's seminal seatbelt study and led the Transport Minister to 
form a task force with the provinces to look at implementing seatbelts on school buses across 
the country. 
The Hillman Foundation announced Monday that CUNY professor and historian, Joshua B. 
Freeman, is the recipient of its 2019 Sol Stetin Award for Labor History. Freeman has written 
extensively about the history of labor, industry, modern America, and New York City. The 
Hillman Foundation established the award in 2005 to honor a labor historian who has made 
significant contribution to the field, researching and telling the stories of working peoples' lives. 
Since 1950, the Hillman's Prizes for Journalism honor the legacy of Sidney Hillman, an 
immigrant who dedicated his life to a "better America." Hillman believed that a free press was 
essential to a fair and equal society. The Sidney Hillman Foundation has sought to carry on his 
legacy by honoring journalists who illuminate the great issues of our times—from the search for 
a basis for lasting peace, to the need for better housing, medical care, and employment security 
for all people, to the promotion of civil liberties and the battle against discrimination based on 
race, nationality, or religion.

Hi Marty, 
Hope all is well. Noticed this Guardian story about Michael Wolff s new book, which states Donald Trump 
purchased a Palm Beach property Mr. Epstein had planned to buy, behind Mr. Epstein's back. And that Mr. 
Epstein threatened to expose Trump's shady real estate deals. Do you know anything about this? Does Mr. 
Epstein have any knowledge of illegal or suspicious dealings by President Trump?

Also, we plan on running a story this Friday about the Crime Victims' Rights Act suit, and the Jane Does' 
proposed remedies. The alleged victims want the U.S. Attorney's Office to rescind the immunity provisions in 
the NPA, and to pursue a prosecution against Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators. Can you comment on this? 
Thanks so much!
