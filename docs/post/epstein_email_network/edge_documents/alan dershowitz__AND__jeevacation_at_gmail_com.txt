Margie, 
IT As you know, nothing too big or too small for us, especially in the summer IT Hmmmmm. I have to be 
direct -- you or someone at your paper was very astute in checking the Clerk and Comptroller's computer 
and activity in the Epstein case two days before the hearing. As result, you sent me a text message on 
Saturday asking what the activity was about and I confirmed that the plea would take place. You were 
the only member of the news media that I talked with. And yet, after the case is completely over, the 
Palm Beach Daily News' editorial staff remains silent on the topic. 
Thanks,

Two years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey Epstein 
finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 million, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for 
sex. A week ago, the 55-year-old investment banker began serving 18 months in jail. 
But that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for 
prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually 
abused them. And why is Epstein serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state 
prison, where inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year? 
The slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public that there's a different system of 
justice for the wealthy who hire high-powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense 
attorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended O.J. Simpson 
against murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying 
about sex with young women. 
Palm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry Krischer sent the case to 
a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once boasted of accepting only billionaire clients 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021761 
could face a trial. The police had taken a high school transcript, class schedules and phone messages from 
Epstein's home that showed he knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's 
lawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls' character by showing they had chatted on myspace.com about 
smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide whether the victims - and Epstein - were 
credible. 
Ultimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the plea agreement left 
Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein had been convicted at a trial, he could 
have been sentenced to anything from probation to 15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna 
Belohlavek said, adding that the recommended guideline sentence was 21 months. 
Epstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically required of sex 
offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court supervision, who will ensure Epstein is in 
fact being treated? 
The plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was warranted, how does 
dropping it before completion benefit the public? 
Epstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his lawyers bought him 
the protection the state attorney owed to the victims. 
Police chief's reputation helps discredit attacks

In the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are accused of 
wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter. 
Epstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution solely because of Reiter's 
"craziness," one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department disseminated "a distorted view of the case" and 
behaved in a "childish" manner when the grand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another 
Epstein lawyer complained. To hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the 
sheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce. 
Reiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, Jill, last year, after 24 years of marriage. They have a son, 18, 
and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go to mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file 
suggests their split is particularly ugly. 
Reiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney's office for two reasons. First, he 
pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of sexual activity with minors. Second, he 
slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt language seldom used by one law-enforcement official 
concerning another because of what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case. 
In a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case "highly unusual." He added, 
"I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the 
prosecution of these cases." 
In short, Reiter told the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. "It looks 
like a departure from professionalism," Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said of 
Reiter's letter. 
Following Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether the super-rich, super-
connected defendant had violated any federal laws. 
Reiter won't discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one word to 
describe the chief: professional. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021762 
"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership," said Rick Lincoln, chief of the 
Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 years. 
"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all consider Mike to be our peer and a 
man of integrity." 
Juno Beach Police Chief H.C. Clark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on 
countywide law enforcement issues. "I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen anything but a 
professional demeanor from him." 
Reiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol job at the University 
of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job evaluations. 
Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a resident confined to his home with a 
sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. 
Another resident thanked Reiter for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have 
been at fault. 
Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. And he's no novice at 
investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the lead detective probing the drug overdose 
death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was one of the officers who worked the investigation of William 
Kennedy Smith, who was charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy 
family compound in Palm Beach. 
Reiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University, also 
has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and management courses at Harvard. He's been 
active in countywide interagency law enforcement organizations and has a "top secret" national security 
clearance. 
"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town," said Town Manager Peter 
Elwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes more than $144,000 as 
the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it. 
"He's very businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the work," 
Elwell said. "I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus years."

Disgusting: Clinton Snared In Pedophile Ring 
Will having friends in high places exempt him from the rule of law? 
Kris Zane — March 27, 2014  
According to former child sex slave Virginia Roberts and a class action lawsuit against convicted billionaire 
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, former President Bill Clinton was present during sex parties involving up to twenty 
underage girls at Epstein's secluded island in the Caribbean. That flight records show Clinton was flown on 
numerous occasions to the island on Epstein's private jet. Clinton had a close relationship with an employee of 
Epstein's who compiled thousands of photos of nude young girls posed in lewd positions. And these photos 
were used as a catalog for Epstein to loan out his girls to powerful politicians and British royalty, including Bill 
Clinton. 
According to the lawsuit:  
Advertisement-content continues below 
...Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who "kept images of naked underage children on her computer, 
helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed underage females in sexually explicit 
poses." 
While Epstein was indicted and jailed for his pedophilia, Bill Clinton oddly has remained unscathed, more than 
likely by having friends in high places. 
If Bill Clinton is in fact a pedophile, will the American people demand that he be put away for a very long time 
so that he can't hurt any more children? Or will having friends in high places exempt him from the rule of law? 
Time will tell.

Like some of the people stated when he was caught "playing" with Monica......he's just a man. Media blew it 
off, the Demons yelled about going after him just because he was a Demon. I don't think THIS will be "told" to 
the people, especially by the media. Don't want to make this man's wife look bad. Then, remember how "slick" 
asked for the meaning of "is" and "sex." Demons can be some of the most vile and ugly people on the 
planet.......

I am so sick of everyone acting like the Clinton's and even the Kennedy's are royalty. They are just a bunch of 
depraved people, bloated by their excess and wealth. If Clinton has been a part of this w/Epstein, then he should 
be in jail too where he belongs.

And? What will happen? What WILL happen and what SHOULD happen are two different things. The 
lamestream media will never cover this story. Nothing will come of it. To the left, this is just a ho-hum blip. i'll 
be mega-surprised if Reuters even blinks and puts it on an inside back page. The AP won't touch it... so? i 
don't see it making an impact on the Hill's run — not when the media will treat it as a yawner. As a former CPS 
child advocate, i can't print here what i think ought to happen to him....

Nancy, you are so right and it is time now to take back the Peoples White House and don't let this trash back in. 
We have had enough with obama trashing our Great Nation AND THE WHITE HOUSE. I suspect very soon he

Years ago, I watched as the Dirty Old Men of the Panamanian government picked up their little blonde 
playthings from their crib in Panama City. 
I have a feeling that if anyone really investigates the crop of liberal Hypocrats in power today, they would find 
who were the real Dirty Old Men of the party. 
Bubba Clinton is only the first to be exposed.

They do not call him "slick" willy for nothing. Short of an actual photograph or video of him engaging in sex 
with a child there is no way he will get this pinned on him. Just remember how many people (40-50) connected 
to him and "her" that have lost their lives (murdered) and he's never been prosecuted. 
As much as I would like to see him and his carpet munching wife brought down it is just not going to happen, at 
least this way it's not...

its bad enough we have become a joke in the world, our anotited one has crippled our military, but they are

Yeah... lets put that one right over there with the mythical Obama impeachment.What is more likely is that 
NAMBLA now has a new champion and this might become part of the kickstart to force Americans to tolerate 
yet another class of pervert. You don't have to be "religious" to know a pervert when you see one.

This self proved scumbag was impeached as President but got off and he will this time too. The left has so 
utterly turned us into a valueless and degenerate society and is determined to destroy what little of decency is 
left that he will NEVER be held either responsible or accountable for his sins. We have a criminally complicit 
Congress which has allowed the rule of law to cease to matter and when the time comes when they NEED it for 
their OWN SELF PRESERVATION, it will not be available even to them. As they have sown, so shall they 
reap! Between them, The Clintons are the perfect example of what is wrong with the Country at large and one 
of the major reasons we are now stuck with one worse and a set of political parasites who enable HIM to barter 
our freedoms, sovereignty and resources to our enemies. We have a word for those. You all know what it is but 
few in this country call them what they are, not only violators of their sworn oaths of Office but: TRAITORS. 
This one also happens to be apparently, according to this reference, a pedophile. will wonders never Cease or 
for that matter, CEASE TO DISGUST?

Oh Oh! Sounds like Billy Jeff may have really stepped in it this time. I doubt he will ever be prosecuted nor will

Gee, maybe after 0Buttbreath leaves office, evidence will come out of his visit to HOMOsexual bath houses, 
HOMOsexual rendezvous and relationships and dare I say? Evidence of pedophilia with underage boys. 
0Buttbreath has made many enemies as has his wife and the Clintons both. A bit coincidental that the last two

If this is true then it is truly disgusting. That being said, after reading the comments section most of you need to 
get off of your republican high horse. Many republican politricksters have also been embroiled in sex scandals, 
some of them with minors, and some with underage boys. Now before the vains start popping out of your neck 
causing you to respond to me in all caps calling some sort of commie democrat leftist, realize that I hate the 
democrats just as much as I hate the republicans. In fact let's just call them the demublicans or the republicrats, 
whatever your pleasure. Most of you need to realize it's not about the ideology of one party or the other, it's 
about the ideology of power. These politricksters, all of them more stinking rich than average Joe American, get 
in the insulated world of political power and get a sense of invincibility and entitlement. They don't care about 
you or me, not a single one of them. But, as long as we keep seeing each other as the enemy rather than realize 
that they are the real enemy bent on destroying this country and the world then we, our children, and our 
grandchildren are doomed. 
Below is a link to federal sex scandals perpetrated by republicrats and demublicans alike. Keep in mind that this 
list does not include local and state level scandals.

call for help came in. At the time, they claimed that the attack was because of an anti Islamic video. All the 
while, unbeknown to us, we were giving the Syrian Rebels arms, which had already been infiltrated by Al

Bill Clinton has had a sexual problem for his entire life. People like the Clintons, Obamas, Bidens, Reids, 
Schumers, Boehners, Bushs, etc. can willingly, knowingly, & intentionally commit crimes with no recourse. 
The U.S. Supreme Court rules Obamacare is a tax, Most likely will make Hobby Lobby & similar companies do 
what they are morally against, Will likely ultimately rule to enact strict gun control laws if not an outright ban, 
Allow open boarders, & Immigrants. They always rule in the gov'ts favor. Rarely for the citizenship any longer. 
If the Constitution is ever amended and/or rewrote which they are in favor of they need to be given term & 
power limits. They are the Supreme Power of this Nation and have proven to be a bunch of decrepit buffoons.

We knew this when Monica Lewinski "with the Blue Dress with the Semen on it" exposed Billy Clinton, in the 
White Hoer House in DC, he had a B.J. with Monica Under the Desk in the Oval Office when he was 
impeached, but the Nat See Senate would not convict the Pedophile mur-derer of Vince Foster. 
But we see with the new charges coming against the Felon, Hairy Reid, who takes Bribes and Steals as the 
DemoNatSee Leader of the Nat See Controlled Senate. 
All DemoFascistCrats are Lawless and EVIL. 
To think that Ronald Reagan would not remove his Suite Jacket in the Oval Office because he had such respect

The girls listed here (well not here, in an article longer than a twitter post) are of age in every European country, 
and Canada. Just like age of drinking, you guys are the anomaly with a higher degree of repression in all social 
areas. 
The reason for that is the crazy -ass, hate spewing, xenophobic, ignorant political bandwagons and scape-
goating your society is rife with. Right now you're trying to figure out how you can blame this on Obama aren't 
you? Yeah I know. Obama. His fault. Somehow. (Actually several posts already are) 
That said, yeah he's stupid. He should follow the laws of his own country. If that's your laws he should be 
following them. 
However, nobody here has the slightest friggen idea if any of this is the least bit true, but you're already 
forming the lynch mobs. 
It's not because you're really upset about the issue at hand. It's hatred of your fat and miserable existence, your 
subscription and indoctrination in to disgusting and brutal pseudo-religious political beliefs, and your lazy 
inability to fact check a thing for yourself when you find it so much easier to ride on a bandwagon. 
Search "consistency theory", if you can handle all the big words and ideas, and you'll figure out why you are 
unable to learn and grow as people. 
I swear most of you can't create or express an idea without it being ascribed to a political view.

Huh? Wha? I'm figuring you're not an American citizen. You "bunched" up all into a group that you describe 
with some wonderful words. Maybe YOU know the WHOLE TRUTH, there are plenty who recall how a newly 
elected President had to give MONEY to a couple of women who had been "assaulted" by this scum bag. Check 
the news papers.......no not twitter.......Maybe you don't know about the "White Water" scandal or about 
Vince Foster, who "shot" himself in the RIGHT side of his head; the man must have been so depressed he used 
his "off' hand to pull the trigger. Maybe his left hand just shook too much. The "Monica" escapade was just a 
man having a fling with a silly woman, makes no mind the woman was the same age as his daughter. HE LIED 
UNDER OATH TO A FEDERAL JUDGE. He stood in front of the entire country and stated "he did not have 
sex with that woman." As for political view points.......isn't that how governments are elected? I don't know 
what country you live in, but here we like to THINK before voting, OOPS! I mean generally; right now there 
are too damn many NON thinking casting ballots. That's how we got slick and now Obummer.

Well, your post just proved my point about not being able to base an idea independent from a political view. 
About categorizing a populace: anyone intelligent enough to think for themselves isn't going to need me to 
validate their self-worth, and realises within themselves that this label doesn't apply to them.

Good thing it was on here for a moment or two, because once the powers that be get their paws on this, Bubba, 
The Pervert info, they will bend over backward to make it disappear from view. 
By the time 2016 rolls around, Hillary and the co-president (Bubba) will be scrubbed squeaky clean and she'll 
be so sanitized, the Pope will bow to her when she deigns to meet him.

I find the funniest thing is the word "Choice" has been taken over by the pro-abortion mob, and the stupid 
people of the former united States don't have any choice, anymore, period. 
If we had a smidgen of Choice anymore, the Clintons would be whining about getting paroled from their 
original prison sentences for wasting Vince Foster — on, get this, humanitarian grounds. 
We have no choice. All you have to do is open your eyes and you'll see that we're still nothing but the serfs 
who pay for the daily antics of the lords. Nothing has changed.

I'm not surprised that a proven serial-rapist, murderer and drug trafficker would also be a pedophile. The leader 
of the administration before his, yes that guy, was also linked to a pedophile prostitution ring uncovered in the 
Franklin pedophile investigation. Research it; and also the name Johnny Gosh. It's a fascinating true story.

The clintons are just evil vial people and I am not surprised about this at all. Also there was a comment asking 
about the ages of those girls involved? "Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who "kept images of 
naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed 
underage females in sexually explicit poses."

Pretty much covers that they were in fact underage children. Makes me sick to my stomach and would love to 
see "old icky billy" get his just reward but doubt it as the article also states, "because of friends in High Places".

This is an old story. When Mr. Clinton was in the WH, there were stories going around that he was at one of his 
numerous cocaine parties and got an under-aged girl hooked on dope.

Subject: Filing in Epstein case 
Hi Prof. Dershowitz: 
I've been following the Jeffrey Epstein litigation saga on and off for some time. 
When I checked the federal court docket last night, I came across the attached filing. It makes some serious 
allegations about you and several other people related to the case. 
I wanted to make sure you had a copy of the filing and to ask if you have any comments on the allegations 
raised in it. 
I'm planning to write a blog entry or story on this and will probably do so fairly soon since the filing is a 
public record at this point. 
Anyway, if you want to respond, please let me know as soon as possible. 
Thanks

Hi Alan 
I was reading through the files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, including the original criminal case where 
you defended Mr. Epstein, and saw a letter both you and Gerald Lefcourt co-authored on his behalf dated July 
6, 2007. 
The letter said "Mr. Epstein was part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative, which is 
described as a project 'bringing together a community of global leaders to devise and implement innovative 
solutions to some of the world's most pressing challenges.' Focuses of this initiative include poverty, climate 
change, global health, and religious and ethnic conflicts." 
I just wanted to clarify if Mr. Epstein was on the board of directors or listed as a founder anywhere or on any 
paperwork associated with the foundation and if so, in what capacity. Also wanted to clarify what you 
specifically mean by being part of the original group. 
I attached a screen shot of the exact passage I am referring to. 
Thanks,

Congratulations to the 2019 Hillman Prize recipients! 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021113 
Sidney Hillman Foundation Names Winners of 2019 Prizes 
for Journalism in Service of the Common Good 
Reuters, NBC News and MSNBC, ProPublica Receive Honors; Adam Serwer to 
receive Opinion & Analysis Prize 
NEW YORK — The Sidney Hillman Foundation announced Tuesday winners of the 69th annual 
Hillman Prizes, recognizing a Reuters expose of slum-like living conditions on U.S military 
bases, the Miami Herald's investigation into Labor Secretary Alex Acosta's sweetheart deal with 
serial sex abuser, Jeffrey Epstein, and NBC News and MSNBC's reporting on the Trump 
Administration's family separation policy, among other standout reporting in service of the 
common good. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021114 
Hannah Dreier of ProPublica won a Hillman Prize for reporting that showed how the 
government's bungled crackdown on MS-13 has torn apart the lives of Latino immigrants. The 
Atlantic's Adam Serwer, who has emerged as a defining voice of the Trump era, won for his 
essays on racism and Trump's political movement, and Anna Clark won for her book on the 
Flint water crisis. 
This year's prizes were judged by writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, the New Yorker's Jelani Cobb, 
Reuters' Alb( Freedman, the New Yorker's Hendrik Hertzberg, the American Prospect's Harold 
Meyerson and The Nation's Katrina vanden Heuvel. 
The 2019 winners of the Hillman Prizes are: 
• Newspaper — Miami Herald, Julie K. Brown and Emily Michot: Perversion of Justice 
• Magazine — ProPublica with New York magazine, Newsday, This American Life, New 
York Times Magazine, Hannah Dreier: Trapped in Gangland 
• Web — Reuters, Joshua Schneyer, Michael Pell, Andrea Januta, Deborah Nelson: 
Ambushed at Home 
• Broadcast — NBC News and MSNBC, Jacob Soboroff and Julia Ainsley: Torn Apart: 
Crisis at the Border 
• Opinion & Analysis — Adam Serwer, The Atlantic 
• Book — Anna Clark: The Poisoned City: Flint's Water and the American Urban 
Tragedy, Metropolitan Books 
Reporting by this year's prize winners has had significant positive impact, including: 
• Reversal of the Trump administration's "Zero Tolerance" family separation policy 
• Three federal investigations, new legislation, widespread repairs, and a $386 million 
emergency program to inspect military housing for hazards 
• The exposure of pervasive bias and negligence by Long Island police, leading to federal 
and local investigations and reforms 
This year's honorees follow in the trailblazing tradition of past winners ranging from Murray 
Kempton in 1950 for his articles on labor in the south and Edward R. Murrow in 1954 for his 
critical reports on civil liberties and Joseph McCarthy at the height of the Red Scare; to 2017 
newspaper winner, David Fahrenthold, for exposing Donald Trump's sexual harassment and 
mismanagement of his foundation. 
The Hillman Prizes are open to journalists and subjects globally for any work widely accessible 
to a U.S. audience. Winners will be awarded a $5,000 prize at the Hillman Foundation's annual 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021115 
ceremony in New York City on May 7. 
"In a time when this country's highest powers have taken it as their business to demean the 
work of journalists, it is particularly significant for us to honor those who have taken up the 
tools of journalism to challenge corrupt power wherever it may reside," said Hillman judge Ta-
Nehisi Coates. 
In 2011, the Sidney Hillman Foundation inaugurated the Canadian Hillman Prize. This year's 
winners, Harvey Cashore, Bob McKeown and Kimberly Ivany of CBC's The Fifth Estate, won for 
their sweeping investigation into the research and regulatory failures that have put millions of 
children at risk on their way to and from school each day. Their reporting exposed fraudulent 
science behind Transport Canada's seminal seatbelt study and led the Transport Minister to 
form a task force with the provinces to look at implementing seatbelts on school buses across 
the country. 
The Hillman Foundation announced Monday that CUNY professor and historian, Joshua B. 
Freeman, is the recipient of its 2019 Sol Stetin Award for Labor History. Freeman has written 
extensively about the history of labor, industry, modern America, and New York City. The 
Hillman Foundation established the award in 2005 to honor a labor historian who has made 
significant contribution to the field, researching and telling the stories of working peoples' lives. 
Since 1950, the Hillman's Prizes for Journalism honor the legacy of Sidney Hillman, an 
immigrant who dedicated his life to a "better America." Hillman believed that a free press was 
essential to a fair and equal society. The Sidney Hillman Foundation has sought to carry on his 
legacy by honoring journalists who illuminate the great issues of our times—from the search for 
a basis for lasting peace, to the need for better housing, medical care, and employment security 
for all people, to the promotion of civil liberties and the battle against discrimination based on 
race, nationality, or religion.
