Hi Darren: 
I hope you are well. 
Since we are no longer working for Jeffrey, I'm forwarding this Daily News request to you so you can handle it as you see 
fit. 
Many thanks,

Subject: Daily News story on Jeffrey Epstein 
Howard: 
We're working on a story for our Sunday column about Jeffrey Epstein. I thought I might send 
my questions to you tonight, so you'd have them first thing tomorrow. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030999 
Would you like to comment on the following: 
1. You've said that the women pressing suits against Mr. Epstein "have lied repeatedly, and in 
no way shape or form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. And one 
of them showed Epstein a fake ID." What do you have to say now that Mr. Epstein has 
admitted in his federal plea bargain that he did conspire to entice minors to engage in 
prostitution? Accepting that these women came voluntarily, isn't Mr Epstein still guilty of 
statutory rape? 
2. Brad Edwards, an attorney who represents three of the women, recently served a 
Subpoena to Testify at a Deposition on Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine 
Maxwell. The Subpoena asks that Maxwell produce "a list of all girls" that visited 
Jeffrey Epstein's homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan, or flew on his 
planes. Edwards said in an interview that Maxwell was "second-in-command of 
Epstein's criminal enterprise." He added, "She was on Epstein's plane, transporting girls 
for the purpose of having sex with other people. She kept a computer database of hundreds of 
girls and oversaw the schedule of girls who came to Epstein's homes." 
3. A suit filed last May by "Jane Doe 102" against Epstein alleges that, after recruiting her as a 15-
year-old girl to give Epstein massages, Maxwell and Epstein took part in "sexually assaulting, 
battering, exploiting, and abusing Plaintiff." 
4. The same suit alleges that Epstein "lured" the girl "every day for next two weeks" to his 
house. The suit claims that she eventually became a "sex slave" to Epstein, traveling with him 
around the world. "In all of these locations, she was required to engage in sex acts with him and 
other women - including other minors." 
5. Did Jane Doe 102 — who now lives in Australia — go on the 2002 trip where 
President Clinton flew on Mr. Epstein's Boeing 727? 
6. "Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when defendant [Jane Doe 102] knew 
that the plaintiff was approximately 15, 16 and 17 years old and, after years of daily sexual 
exploitation continued into her adulthood ... until she fled at age 19," 
7. When Maxwell and Epstein celebrated Jane Doe 102's 16th birthday with her, Epstein joked that 
he would have to "trade her in" because she was getting too old for him. 
8. Not only was Jane Doe 102 required to satisfy Epstein's "every sexual whim," but she also was 
exploited by Epstein's adult male peers. They included "royalty, politicians, academicians, 
businessmen and others in various locations around the world." 
9. The Palm Beach Post and lawyers representing Epstein's alleged victims have called his federal 
non-prosecution agreement a "secret," "backroom," "sweetheart" deal, noting that none of his 
alleged victims was consulted. Several critics have claimed Epstein "bought" the agreement, using 
politically-connected lawyers. Would he like to comment? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031000 
10. Is Epstein cooperating with federal suit against Bear Steams hedge fund managers Ralph Cioffi 
and Matthew Tannin? Willhetestifyintheircases? 
11. Mr Epstein was deposed on this week, on Thursday. Is it true that he answered almost every 
question by invoking his FifthAmendmentrights? 
12. Defense attorney Brad Evans has filed a motion to freeze Mr Epstein's assets. Has Mr. 
Epstein moved his money from the US offshore or abroad, or does he intend to, in order to 
protect his assets from possible damage claims? 
13. What did Mr. Epstein do during his work release program while serving time. Reports have 
said he engaged in "scientific research." If so, what was he researching? 
14. Has Mr. Epstein returned to pursuing his investment business? Is Mr Epstein still on 
probation? 
15. Is Mr. Epsteinpermittedto leave FloridaortheUnited States? Do authoritiesholdhis 
passport? 
You can reach me via e-mail or at or . We close our column at 3 
pm on Friday but can add comments as late as 3 pm on Saturday. Many thanks.

To: Jack Goldberger 
Subject: RE: Please forward 
I am writing in an attempt to make contact with Jeffrey Epstein and wondered if you would, as his attorney, forward this 
message on to him? 
We are keen to explore the possibility of conducting an interview with Mr Epstein, on the subject of the stories which are 
circulating, however inaccurately, about both him and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; we'd be keen to hear from Mr Epstein 
first hand so that the various and at times, speculative reporting which is at large in the UK press can be better scrutinised? 
Let me tell you a bit about the Today programme. 
Today is the BBC's main morning news show; we have been part of the BBC for over 50 years and are generally considered 
one of the most important news broadcast outlets - either on radio or TV- here in the UK. We set the news agenda for the BBC 
and in many respects we set the daily news agenda for the country. Our interviews are regularly re broadcast across the BBC's 
national and international news network including - BBC World, BBC World Service and BBC Online. The combination of 
these outlets means the global 'reach' of a BBC Today programme interview is second to none. 
Programme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international relations and 
the arts including US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, President Nicholas Sarkozy, President Hamid Karzai, HRH the Prince 
of Wales, former President Musharraf, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former President Bill Clinton, Senator 
George Mitchell, Al Gore, Kofi Annan, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Dalai Lama, Bill Gates, George Soros, Stephen 
Hawking, Sir Paul McCartney, Mick Jaggar and Salman Rushdie. 
We are a programme that carries considerable weight and influence and which prides itself in being a first port of call for many 
of the most important and influential figures on the international stage. 
I can best be reached via my cell phone - 
My very best wishes and my thanks!
