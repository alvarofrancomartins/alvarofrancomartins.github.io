I just got my G550 - 5176 under contract at $18.5 and it's going to Pre-Purchase inspection on Monday. 
I'm aware that G550 - 5109 was under contract for $17,600,000. 
As a company we have 5 G550, 2 G650 and 1 BBJ buyers. 
That is all I know for now.

Date: 5/22/2017 6:58:42 AM
Subject: Iran and Trump Speech.
From: alireza lttihadieh
To: jeevacation@gmail.com
Direction: alireza lttihadieh → jeevacation@gmail.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Rouhani's supporters also expect his victory, with 57 percent of the vote, to bolster his 
outreach efforts to the West and the pursuit of more foreign investment to lift Iran's ailing 
economy. 
For those who voted for Mr. Rouhani, there was a feeling of tremendous relief that his challenger, 
the hard-line cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who criticized the nuclear deal with the United States and 
other Western powers, had lost. 
"Bye-bye, Raisi," the crowds chanted during the street gatherings. 
"He faces a difficult task," Fazel Meybodi, a Shiite Muslim cleric from the city of Qum, said of Mr. 
Rouhani. "Now he must provide more freedoms, break the hard-line monopoly on the state-run 
radio and television, and increase freedom of press." 
To achieve all that, Mr. Rouhani must persuade the hard-line-dominated judiciary and security 
forces to change their outlook, Mr. Meybodi said. "If he fails to deliver on at least 70 percent of 
those promises, his future is dark," he added. 
For decades, Saudi Arabia and Iran have competed for religious leadership and political influence 
across the Muslim world and beyond. 
Trump is correct, however, Rouhani needs a chance to act.
