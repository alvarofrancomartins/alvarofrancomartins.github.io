11 Places With a Worse Economy Than USA 
By Rick Newman — Fri Jul 10, 11:50 am ET 
When times are tough, one thing that tends to raise the spirits is knowing that somebody else has it worse. And as wretched as the 
U.S. economy seems, its not as bad as in other regions. 
The International Monetary Fund's latest tally of world economic conditions forecasts a 2.6 decline in U.S. economic output for all of 
2009, and anemic growth of 0.8 percent in 2010. That's more optimistic than the IMF's prediction from three months ago, but those 
are still lousy numbers. A weak economy throughout 2010 would mean a bleak employment picture, an agonizingly slow housing 
recovery, and another year or two likely to feel like a recession, whether its technically labeled that or not. 
We should count ourselves lucky, though. The IMF expects at least 11 major parts of the world to have more severe economic 
contractions than the United State this year, including most of western Europe, Japan, Russia, and Mexico. Europe will still be 
stumbling along behind the United States next year, as well. Here are the IMF's projections for economic growth in various parts of 
the world: 
2009. 2010 
China. 	7.5. 	8.5 
India. 	5.4 	6.5 
Middle East 2.0 	3.7 
Africa. 1.8 4.7 
Brazil. -1.3 2.5 
World total -1.4 2.5 
Canada. 	-2.3 	1.6 
U.S. 	-2.6 	0.8 
France. 	-3.0 	0.4 
Spain. 	-4.0 	-0.8 
U.K. 	-4.2 	0.2 
E U. 	-4.7 	-0.1 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021231 
E Europe. -5.0 1.0 
Italy. 	-5.1 	-0.1 
Japan. 	-6.0 	1.7 
Germany. 	-6.2 	-0.6 
Russia. 	-6.5 	1.5 
Mexico. 	-7.3 	3.0 
If these projections come true, it means the United States, despite its overspent consumers, wrecked banks, and insolvent auto 
makers, will be leading the world economy out of recession. Somehow. The developing world will help, but those high growth 
projections in China and India can be deceiving. 
China in particular has government policies that practically mandate high growth, and 8.5 percent in 2010 would be just about the 
bare minimum to keep employment at tolerable levels. And neither China nor India is a major buyer of American-made goods and 
services; for the most part, its the other way around. With much of the developed world trailing the United States, it will take 
American consumers to ratchet up demand for the world's products. Scary thought. 
How to tell when a real recovery begins.? 
4 Ways to Tell When a Real Recovery Has Begun 
You could conclude just about anything from the daily cavalcade of economic statistics. Some suggest an imminent recovery. Others 
seem to foretell years of gloom. The bent of the expert interpreting the latest news—bull, bear, Obama-basher, Wall Street-hater—
has as much to do with the outlook as the numbers themselves. 
For the foreseeable future, there will be an aggressive hunt for two economic recoveries. One is the technical improvement in 
economic indicators that signals the economy is growing again. That's the one economists care about, which is why they scour the 
numbers on retail sales, business inventories, purchasing manager sentiment, subatomic inflation, the mood in Shanghai, and 
anything else that could help pinpoint the exact inflection point for a turnaround. 
The other recovery, the one that most consumers are waiting for, is the one in which companies stop firing and start hiring, banks 
return to normal lending, and families stop worrying about jobs and income. And that turnaround—the consumer recovery—is likely 
to take much longer to materialize than the technical recovery. 
The danger of hyping a technical recovery is that it will arrive, with much fanfare—but fail to make ordinary consumers feel better 
off. Many economists, for example, are predicting that the recession will officially end by this summer or fall. The only problem is 
that when a technical recovery begins, a lot of companies fail to get the memo. They don't play along; they keep payrolls lean and 
maybe even continuing to lay off workers. So to guard against false optimism, here's how to tell when a real recovery is finally 
kicking into gear: 
Unemployment improves. The single best indicator of the health of the economy is the job market. People who have lost their job, or 
worry that they might, obviously hoard their money and don't spend. That spells doom for an economy driven by consumer spending, 
as ours is. But once its clear that jobs are coming back, consumers are more likely to relax and open their wallets. 
Projections about unemployment should make anybody queasy about the prospects for a recovery this year. The unemployment rate 
is currently 9.4 percent, a steep rise from one year ago, when it was an unremarkable 5.5 percent. And by most accounts, its going to 
get worse. The International Monetary Fund expects the U.S. unemployment rate to be 10.1 percent in 2010. Economist Gary 
Shilling thinks unemployment will hit 11.4 percent and not peak until late next year. 
Its hard to imagine a "recovery" in which jobs are even more scarce than they are now. When the unemployment rate finally starts to 
go in the other direction, we can start to think about putting the umbrellas away. Until then, no number of upticks or volume of 
optimistic talk will persuade Americans worried about their jobs that they should part with precious cash. 
Housing prices stabilize. This has become a mantra by now: For the economy to get healthy, housing prices must stop falling. 
Problem is, the houses haven't been listening. 
Housing matters for two reasons: It represents a big chunk of the economy, and its the largest single repository of Americans' 
household wealth. With prices falling, buyers are scarce, since nobody wants to buy an expensive good today if its going to be worth 
less tomorrow. With few buyers, all the other economic activity that swirls around real estate—remodeling, appliance and furniture 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021232 
sales, relocation services—is depressed. Homeowners are worse off, too, because the value of one of their vital assets is eroding. 
House prices have already fallen by 32 percent nationwide from the 2006 peak. And they have further to go. The latest readings on 
the S&P/Case-Schiller home price index, one prominent measure, showed another record decline in May. At some point, the declines 
will moderate and stop being records. But prices need to stop falling altogether, and probably rise, for a real recovery to happen. The 
Federal Reserve thinks home prices could stop falling in 2010, after a total decline of 41 to 48 percent. Other metrics, like housing 
starts and new-home sales, might point upward before then. Those will be signs of signs of a turnaround, not the real thing. 
Household wealth increases. The housing bust and the volatile stock market have hammered the traditional investment tools that 
most Americans use, causing epic declines in the wealth of Americans. Since 2006, household net worth has declined by about $12 
trillion, which equates to about $107,000 of lost wealth for each of America's 112 million households. That's partly because of the 40 
percent plunge in the stock market since October 2007 and partly because of the steep declines in real estate values. 
Americans simply own less, too. Home equity for the typical homeowner is just 41.1 percent, a record low. In 2002, it was 58.4 
percent. Owning less means we owe more and will have to rebuild savings before we can spend like we used to. "This will be a drag 
on all discretionary purchases," says Dirk van Dijk, an analyst at Zacks Investment Research who thinks the tightfistedness will cut 
into the earnings of firms ranging from hotel chains to furniture makers to motorcycle manufacturers. Those are the same kinds of 
companies that need to start hiring again for a real recovery to develop. But they won't if sales stay sluggish. A turnaround will 
require sustained stock market gains and an end to the housing bust. 
President Obama stops fudging on the economy. There's still a lot that could go wrong, and Obama knows it. Yet part of the 
president's job is to reassure skittish Americans, even as his economic lieutenants are fighting battles in the war room. That's why 
Obama has been making half-hearted pronouncements, like saying that the economy shows "some return to normalcy" and that "we 
expect there'll be some stabilization of the economy." Virtually all of Obama's remarks on the economy contain modifiers and future 
tense and a not-quite-there-yet quality, since hell blow his own credibility if he tries to convince Americans that they're better off 
than they actually are. When Obama starts hedging less, be happy. That will signal better days. Finally. 
The IMF does offer a bit of more heartening news: The global wipe out finally seems to be receding. "The world economy is 
stabilizing," the IMF reports. Its global economic growth projection of 2.5 percent in 2010 is 0.6 points higher than predicted in 
April. But the global economy isn't expected to gain its footing in earnest until the second half of 2010. Maybe by then American 
spenders will have come out of hiding. 
Obama says stimulus plan to kick in later this year Reuters 
Obama says stimulus plan to kick in later this year 
By Tom Doggett — Sat Jul 11, 3:13 pm ET 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) — President Barack Obama said Saturday more time was needed for his $787 billion stimulus package to 
work, predicting the spending would have a bigger impact on the economy later this year. 
In an advanced text of his weekly radio speech, Obama said the stimulus plan approved by Congress and signed into law in mid-
February "was not designed to work in four months -- it was designed to work over two years." 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said it was too soon to decide whether the U.S. economy needed the help of a second-
round of government stimulus to recover from recession. 
"I don't think that's a judgment we need to make now, can't really make it now prudently, responsibly," he said in a taped interview 
with CNN that will air Sunday. 
According to a transcript provided by CNN, Geithner said the "biggest thrust" of the stimulus package signed into law earlier this 
year would take effect in the second half of the year. 
Obama's comments follow government data showing the unemployment rate soared to 9.5 percent in June, the highest level since 
1983 and above the 8 percent peak predicted by the White House when it worked with Congress to pass the package. Republicans 
say the stimulus plan is not working. 
Obama now warns unemployment likely will top 10 percent in the coming months. 
"We must let (the stimulus plan) work the way its supposed to, with the understanding that in any recession, unemployment tends to 
recover more slowly than other measures of economic activity," Obama said. 
He said the benefits of the plan would "accelerate greatly throughout the summer and the fall." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021233 
The continuing recession and further steep job losses are wearing away the patience of Americans and raising doubts about Obama's 
handling of the economy. 
The share of Americans who believe the stimulus package will restore the economy slipped to 52 percent in late June, down from 59 
percent two months earlier, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. 
Vice President Joe Biden said the administration had "misread" how bad the economy was when it took office but that the stimulus 
package would help the economy recovery and create jobs. 
Senate Republican Leader Mich McConnell Friday called the stimulus plan a failure. 
Obama said it takes time for the plan's money "to get out the door" to pay for roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that will 
create jobs "because we are committed to spending it in a way that is effective and transparent."

Peace Hope Tuesday, Sep 01 2009, 3:11PMThis is a guest note by Jim Krane, a former AP Persian Gulf correspondent. His new 
book on Dubai, City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism, is available. 
As Americans, Israelis and Palestinians continue their endless peace-jockeying, a more hopeful solution has emerged. It is a fresh 
Arab initiative that depends neither on America nor Israel. 
It is Dubai. 
Dubai, you must know, is the flashy Gulf city-state that is one of the seven United Arab Emirates. In my book, I argue that Dubaians, 
descended from illiterate Bedouin who faced starvation in the 1940s, have authored the most exciting Arab accomplishment in 700 
years. 
>From nowhere, Dubai has mushroomed into a trading city-state on the lines of Hong Kong and Singapore, with sidelines in real 
estate and tourism. 
Dubai accomplished all this without (much) oil, and without the help - or even recognition of the United States. While Washington 
has been caught up prolonging the Israel-Palestinian conflict and starting a war in Iraq, Dubai was erecting one of the worlds most 
spectacular cities. So, how can Dubai fix the Middle East? It certainly can't do much to help Palestinians suffering under Israeli 
misrule. 
But that is the point. Dubai has succeeded in spite of the plight of the Palestinians, and in spite of what Arab leaders describe as US 
meddling that stymies their development. One of the favorite themes of Dubai leader Sheikh Mohammed is that his counterparts 
should stop bloviating about the Israelis and start serving the interests of their own citizens. 
Dubai's wild growth backs up Sheikh Mohammed's message. His business-before-politics way is becoming a development model for 
the rest of the Arab world. 
But wait, Dubai is in financial trouble. How could it be a role model?Dubai's downturn is temporary. Being one of the worlds most 
globalized cities, it couldn't help but be infected by a global recession. The contagion kneecapped each one of its economic pillars: 
Shipping, logistics, tourism, and its binging real estate sector. Most of these pillars remain sound. 
Dubai's economic example isn't widely understood in Washington. But its a good thing. Emulating Dubai could make Arab countries 
more stable and secure, along with the rest of us. For America, which has mistreated Dubai despite synergies with our interests, its a 
windfall. 
If you remember, Dubai in 2006 bought US port operations and found itself vilified as a terrorist logistics center. Members of 
Congress now in the Obama administration -- among them the senator who is now president -- joined the Dubai-bashing. Well, it 
may turn out that this "terrorist logistics center" has one of the keys for fixing the Mideast's terrorism problem. 
The Dubai model is a mixture of social freedom, unbridled immigration, and raw capitalism. It is overseen by a government that is 
one of the world's least democratic. This is no accident. Dubai avoids both elections and the Arab obsession with politics, especially 
the syndrome of feeling slighted by the West. 
Dubai is pragmatic. It makes money doing business with Israel and Iran, countries shunned by other Arab states. The city's finessing 
of simultaneous friendships with Washington and Tehran is as deft as it is precarious. 
Dubai's government wrings efficiencies using schemes from Harvard Business School and General Electric. Its use of strategic 
planning is a new concept in the Middle East. Dubai conceives developments, like no-tax business parks, and builds them exactly as 
promised. 
In contrast with the surrounding police states, Dubai functions on the honor system. Alcohol is legal. Prostitution is tolerated. A nice 
example is the e-Gate scheme, which allows residents to use a biometric card to skip passport control. None of the neighbors has the 
confidence to replace state security with a smart card. Not Saudi Arabia, not Iran, not Israel. 
Saudis and Iranians, especially, find a refreshing dignity in Dubai, a respect for their ability to make the right choice. "Friday you can 
pray, but Thursday night you might want to go to the bar," says a Dubai-based Saudi. "It's up to you. "Dubai is certainly taking risks. 
But rulers from Morocco to Iran are already Xeroxing parts of the Dubai playbook and waiting to see how the more controversial 
approaches pan out. For some, its a matter of self-preservation: Dubai's state-led development doesn't involve elections. For others 
its a bid to stop the hemorrhage of bright citizens and cash fleeing to Dubai. 
All of them ought to do more. Egypt, with its unemployed masses, could make use of Dubai's incentives for foreign investment. 
Syria might adopt its free trade ways. Iraq and Israel could use a dose of its religious tolerance. And its Gulf neighbors might 
streamline their bureaucracies as Dubai has. 
Of course, there are areas where neighbors emulate Dubai to their detriment. Dubai's abusive "in-sourced" labor market is one. Real 
estate is another. One hopes Dubai's property crash taught admirers what not to copy. And Dubai pays no heed to the environment. 
Thus Dubaians, with their monster 4x4s and chilled swimming pools, are the worlds most prolific polluters.

the accompanying stability and peace it implies. Its time Washington took notice.-- Jim

Do you know what the Most Innovative Location Device is? 
No it's not a compass or an astrolabe. It's not semaphore or a smoke signal. Not an RFID tag or a 
neon sign or phosphorous flare either. 
Give up? 
It's the GPS Smart ShoeTM recently mentioned in Forbes Magazine, developed by GTX Corp 
(OTCBB: GTX0.0B) and licensed to Aetrex Worldwide. Yes, a shoe. .well a very smart shoe as 
it can tell a caregiver the precise location, bearing, history, speed and altitude of an Alzheimer's 
victim that has eloped or wandered. No small feat — pun intended — to reduce the overwhelming 
stress on the millions of victim caregivers while potentially saving thousands from injuries and 
death owing to exposure, accidents and criminal activity. The GPS Shoe also reduces the 
manpower drain on municipal services; fire, police and welfare agencies often enlisted to locate 
the mentally ill. 
While a Finalist in the Most Innovative Location Device category of the Locations & Beyond 
Summit and the People's Choice Awards is a wonderful acknowledgment for the years GTXO 
invested in developing the solution and the promise that Aetrex has made in bringing the Shoe to 
market... the real winners are those touched by this devastating disease for which there is no cure, 
but now have a new measure of hope.

Keeping an eye on Mom and Dad 
Remote monitoring technology aims to keep seniors in their houses and out of nursing homes ____ 
Over the coming months a raft of new-and-improved remote monitoring devices will hit the _____ 
market, from GPS shoes that can track the whereabouts of wandering seniors to MedCottages, 
portable RV-like units equipped with motion and monitoring systems that allow seniors to 
maintain some independence from the backyard of their adult childrens' homes. 
"As we age, this is going to be a growing trend," says Laurie Orlov, a Florida-based expert on so-
called "aging-in-place technology" aimed at keeping seniors in their houses and out of nursing 
homes as long as possible. 
"We have to get past the fear and antagonism among the older people who need it the most. I don't 
think they're that technology-ready, but the boomers, who are their adult children, certainly are." 
Motion sensors strategically placed in the three-bedroom home where Howe has lived for 53 years 
feed information right to her daughter's laptop, detailing when she got out of bed (the Friday we 
chatted it was 9 a.m.), walked into the bathroom (9:15 a.m.) or hovered at the kitchen table where 
she keeps her pills (9:30 a.m.) 
Even her blood-pressure reading (165/76) is fed to her daughter's computer, along with her daily 
weigh-in tally, providing a detailed graph which she often takes to her doctor appointments. 
The only thing GrandCare can't tell Pierce, because her system doesn't include cameras, is if her 
mother actually swallowed her pills. 
Monitoring and in-home help technologies will be a $20 billion U.S. business in North America by 
2020, predicts Orlov, founder of Aging In Place Technology Watch. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 018132 
Already some baby boomers are able to remotely lock their parents' doors, track calls coming into 
their homes and even see who is ringing the doorbell, in many cases right from their smart phones. 
Systems such as QuietCare, WellAWARE, FineThanx and SimplyHome are already fixtures in 
some U.S. homes and seniors' communities, although Orlov estimates fewer than 10,000 units are 
in active use because the systems can be so costly. 
Next month, Paul Whyte, a Markham dealer of smart-home technology that allows ordinary 
electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, will unveil the GrandCare system at 
the Zoomer show in Toronto. 
"I call it the invisible caregiver," says Whyte of Cybernetics Systems Inc. "The minute I saw this 
system I thought, 'There's something that actually makes sense.' 
The key, of course, with all these technologies is that the senior be relatively able-bodied and 
sound of mind — most are of limited value if the senior is suffering from dementia, which is 
expected to become a major public health issue in the next few decades. 
But developers are also working hard on that challenging front. 
Sometime later this fall or next spring the first GPS-equipped shoe, the Aetrex Ambulator, will go 
on sale through www.gpsshoe.com orwww.foot.com. 
Originally designed for children by Los Angeles-based GTX Corp., the new shoes are expected to 
retail for about $250 U.S. They enable caregivers to track those afflicted with dementia or 
Alzheimer's thanks to GPS and cellular technology that will relay their whereabouts back to a 
monitoring centre. 
"Privacy may be a talking point, but it's not really an issue," says Patrick Bertagna, chairman and 
CEO of GTX Corp. 
MEDCottage creator Dupin expects concerns around privacy will fade quickly as families and 
health-care systems here and in the U.S. become overwhelmed by aging baby boomers — more 
than 76 million in the U.S., 10 million in Canada — who start hitting 65 next year. 
"I see remote monitoring becoming an integral part of health care as we all age," says Dupin. "One 
of the issues around aging in place is going to be making trade-offs. Privacy may be something we 
have to give up."

The deal could mean more than 40 million more downloads, which would translate to increased

The LociMobile tracking applications send a GPS signal out to all of a person's cell phone 
contacts who use the app. Bertagna said the app can be used to meet up with friends or keep tabs 
on kids. 
GTX has also developed a GPS shoe for tracking Alzheimer's patients.

Resources and Technology to Help Caregivers Cope 
Kirk Johnson - NYTimes.com - May 4, 2010 - One Alzheimer's wanderer in Arizona had lost 
much of his memory, but not, apparently, his interest in fashion: he never left the house without a 
beloved baseball cap on his head. So a trick the family used to keep the man around was to hide 
his caps. 
Search-and-rescue experts who deal with dementia patients also recommend alarms on doors that 
sound when opened if a proper code is not entered, along with posters or wallpaper images that 
disguise or conceal doors. Sometimes a simple large, emphatic sign on every door saying "Stop!" 
will deter a wanderer.

New App craze brings back the 1990's 
World Market Media - April 9, 2010 - Every Portfolio manager I've 
ever known loves to find a sector with wind at it's back..the early 
users of the "CrackBerry" knew (Nasdaq: RIMM) was the stock 
he/she needed to invest in because every person on Wall Street had 
one. This phenomena doesn't occur often and RIMM"s are as rare as 
Australopithecus. I observe the current app craze as the new cycle for 
lightning quick revenues based on the size of the market itself. 
Certainly anyone with an iPhone or Android phone has imagined that 
they could build an app when they got home that night. .1 know I 
did. 
I can tell you from experience that when Kleiner Perkins doubles the size of its venture fund 
specific to app's you know your watching the ship turning in the harbor. This is a unique space 
with wind at it's back and certainly the app's market is a niche to watch, we found this company 
and had a chance to speak with Patrick Bertagna at GTX Corp (OTCBB:GTX0) its Founder/ 
Chairman and CEO. He had some interesting comments about how the company has evolved and 
found some traction with its wholly owned subsidiary LOCiMOBILE Inc. Bertagna commented 
"With 500 million smart phones entering the market place, I believe we are at the tip of the next 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 018137 
disruptive wave. Apps will become as ubiquitous as the device they live on and that makes this 
new frontier a game changer" Certainly being on the iTunes top ten highest grossing list puts us at

Kids Sneakers That Know Where They Are 
Castro Valley Forum - CA, USA - By : Michael Singer: 10/16/07 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 018144 
There is a trend in high-tech that recommends adding location-based services to anything and 
everything. But it has me pulled between wanting to see really cool gadgets and avoiding a Big 
Brother-like society. 
The latest is a new high-tech tennis shoe coming to the market that lets parents and guardians track 
the movements of their family using Global Positioning Systems or GPS technology. 
Called the "Smart Shoe," the miniature device is inserted in the sole of the low-top sneaker. An 
antenna that runs up the back of the footwear communicates with satellites and relays a location 
back to a subscription Web site service for easy viewing. Los Angeles-based GTXC, which makes 
the devices and the service, said it is hoping to put Smart Shoes in stores by the end of the year. 
Shoes with the technology could cost between $100 and $200. The tracking service is expected to 
cost about $20 a month. 
Follow That Kid 
Today's technology makes it easier for parents to know where their kids are and what they're 
doing. 
By Joe Burris 1Baltimore Sun July 1, 2007 
Michelle Smith had been reluctant to buy a cell phone for her 7-year-old daughter, Daysha. Then 
one day in April, a substitute teacher placed the Radford, Va., girl on the wrong school bus. 
Instead of being dropped off at her older sister's after-school program as planned, Daysha was sent 
home - only to find the doors locked. 
As she sat on her front porch crying, her mother drove around town, searching frantically for the 
girl. No one at the school could tell her which bus the girl had been put on. 
"Then my next-door neighbor called," said Smith, "and said, 'I have your baby.'" 
The scary moment had a happy ending, but Smith didn't want to take a chance on losing her 
daughter again. So she did what many other parents are doing - she bought her child a cell phone 
equipped with an electronic device that could keep track of her whereabouts.

M2M - Specialty Publications - April 6, 2007 
M2M technology providers and system integrators often cite efficiency improvements and new 
revenue opportunities as common indicators of return-on-investment. However, as more and more 
customers use machine-to-machine applications to collect data, security has not only become a 
top-notch priority for end users and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) but also a highly 
valued part of fostering a positive ROI. 
According to IDC Corp., www.idc.com, Framingham, Mass., as devices enabling a mobile 
workforce continue to shrink in size, the increased likelihood of losing devices, such as laptops, 
mobile phones, BlackBerrys, has caused growing concern over the sensitive corporate information 
they contain.

Where would you be without GPS? 
Perhaps carrying fewer gadgets: The technology is being added to shoes, MP3 players, dogs 
By Carolyn Y. Johnson Boston Globe 1February 19, 2007 
This month, GTX Corp. launched a line of Xplorer Smart GPS shoes that transform sneakers into 
a wearable LoJack system. 
ABI Research found that the number of people in North America who subscribe to GPS-enabled 
location-based services more than doubled between 2005 and 2006, from 1.6 to 3.9 million. The 
number of subscribers is projected to rocket to 52 million in 2011. 
That means companies working in what used to be a niche market have been enjoying explosive 
growth. Revenues at TomTom NV, a Concord-based maker of personal navigation products, have 
increased more than 500-fold since 2001, from $2.5 million to an estimated $1.7 billion last 
year. Garmin's business has exploded into the mainstream, too, and the company ran its first 
Super Bowl ad this year. Boston-based start-up Skyhook Wireless brings location awareness to 
any device with WiFi, and announced a major partnership this month with GPS platform maker 
SiRF.

geographic areas can also be defined and alerts sent when the person being tracked leaves or enters

An Open Letter To GTX Corporation's Investors, Customers And Friends 
January 5, 2007 - GTX Corp has received many inquiries this week regarding recent reports that 
another manufacturer has entered the GPS footwear sector claiming, among other things, that they 
have patented GPS footwear technology, and that there is a technology called "Quantum Satellite

represented to the public in an ethical and honest fashion. GTXC takes issue with the claims made

such, GTXC is taking immediate, strong and active steps to respond to those claims in a 
responsible way to inform the public and the relevant media about GTXC, its products and 
technology, and the true status of the following facts.

Do you know what the Most Innovative Location Device is? 
No it's not a compass or an astrolabe. It's not semaphore or a smoke signal. Not an RFID tag or a 
neon sign or phosphorous flare either. 
Give up? 
It's the GPS Smart ShoeTM recently mentioned in Forbes Magazine, developed by GTX Corp 
(OTCBB: GTX0.0B) and licensed to Aetrex Worldwide. Yes, a shoe. .well a very smart shoe as 
it can tell a caregiver the precise location, bearing, history, speed and altitude of an Alzheimer's 
victim that has eloped or wandered. No small feat — pun intended — to reduce the overwhelming 
stress on the millions of victim caregivers while potentially saving thousands from injuries and 
death owing to exposure, accidents and criminal activity. The GPS Shoe also reduces the 
manpower drain on municipal services; fire, police and welfare agencies often enlisted to locate 
the mentally ill. 
While a Finalist in the Most Innovative Location Device category of the Locations & Beyond 
Summit and the People's Choice Awards is a wonderful acknowledgment for the years GTXO 
invested in developing the solution and the promise that Aetrex has made in bringing the Shoe to 
market... the real winners are those touched by this devastating disease for which there is no cure, 
but now have a new measure of hope.

Keeping an eye on Mom and Dad 
Remote monitoring technology aims to keep seniors in their houses and out of nursing homes ____ 
Over the coming months a raft of new-and-improved remote monitoring devices will hit the _____ 
market, from GPS shoes that can track the whereabouts of wandering seniors to MedCottages, 
portable RV-like units equipped with motion and monitoring systems that allow seniors to 
maintain some independence from the backyard of their adult childrens' homes. 
"As we age, this is going to be a growing trend," says Laurie Orlov, a Florida-based expert on so-
called "aging-in-place technology" aimed at keeping seniors in their houses and out of nursing 
homes as long as possible. 
"We have to get past the fear and antagonism among the older people who need it the most. I don't 
think they're that technology-ready, but the boomers, who are their adult children, certainly are." 
Motion sensors strategically placed in the three-bedroom home where Howe has lived for 53 years 
feed information right to her daughter's laptop, detailing when she got out of bed (the Friday we 
chatted it was 9 a.m.), walked into the bathroom (9:15 a.m.) or hovered at the kitchen table where 
she keeps her pills (9:30 a.m.) 
Even her blood-pressure reading (165/76) is fed to her daughter's computer, along with her daily 
weigh-in tally, providing a detailed graph which she often takes to her doctor appointments. 
The only thing GrandCare can't tell Pierce, because her system doesn't include cameras, is if her 
mother actually swallowed her pills. 
Monitoring and in-home help technologies will be a $20 billion U.S. business in North America by 
2020, predicts Orlov, founder of Aging In Place Technology Watch. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 018171 
Already some baby boomers are able to remotely lock their parents' doors, track calls coming into 
their homes and even see who is ringing the doorbell, in many cases right from their smart phones. 
Systems such as QuietCare, WellAWARE, FineThanx and SimplyHome are already fixtures in 
some U.S. homes and seniors' communities, although Orlov estimates fewer than 10,000 units are 
in active use because the systems can be so costly. 
Next month, Paul Whyte, a Markham dealer of smart-home technology that allows ordinary 
electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, will unveil the GrandCare system at 
the Zoomer show in Toronto. 
"I call it the invisible caregiver," says Whyte of Cybernetics Systems Inc. "The minute I saw this 
system I thought, 'There's something that actually makes sense.' 
The key, of course, with all these technologies is that the senior be relatively able-bodied and 
sound of mind — most are of limited value if the senior is suffering from dementia, which is 
expected to become a major public health issue in the next few decades. 
But developers are also working hard on that challenging front. 
Sometime later this fall or next spring the first GPS-equipped shoe, the Aetrex Ambulator, will go 
on sale through www.gpsshoe.com orwww.foot.com. 
Originally designed for children by Los Angeles-based GTX Corp., the new shoes are expected to 
retail for about $250 U.S. They enable caregivers to track those afflicted with dementia or 
Alzheimer's thanks to GPS and cellular technology that will relay their whereabouts back to a 
monitoring centre. 
"Privacy may be a talking point, but it's not really an issue," says Patrick Bertagna, chairman and 
CEO of GTX Corp. 
MEDCottage creator Dupin expects concerns around privacy will fade quickly as families and 
health-care systems here and in the U.S. become overwhelmed by aging baby boomers — more 
than 76 million in the U.S., 10 million in Canada — who start hitting 65 next year. 
"I see remote monitoring becoming an integral part of health care as we all age," says Dupin. "One 
of the issues around aging in place is going to be making trade-offs. Privacy may be something we 
have to give up."

Tracking Deal 
A downtown L.A. company that creates GPS tracking applications for cell phones has 
announced a deal to provide its friend-finding apps on Samsung smart phones. 
The deal could mean more than 40 million more downloads, which would translate to increased 
revenue, for GTX Corp.'s application, which is currently available for the iPhone, BlackBerry and 
Android phones, said GTX Chief Executive Patrick Bertagna. 
The LociMobile tracking applications send a GPS signal out to all of a person's cell phone 
contacts who use the app. Bertagna said the app can be used to meet up with friends or keep tabs 
on kids. 
GTX has also developed a GPS shoe for tracking Alzheimer's patients.

Resources and Technology to Help Caregivers Cope 
Kirk Johnson - NYTimes.com - May 4, 2010 - One Alzheimer's wanderer in Arizona had lost 
much of his memory, but not, apparently, his interest in fashion: he never left the house without a 
beloved baseball cap on his head. So a trick the family used to keep the man around was to hide 
his caps. 
Search-and-rescue experts who deal with dementia patients also recommend alarms on doors that 
sound when opened if a proper code is not entered, along with posters or wallpaper images that 
disguise or conceal doors. Sometimes a simple large, emphatic sign on every door saying "Stop!" 
will deter a wanderer.

New App craze brings back the 1990's 
World Market Media - April 9, 2010 - Every Portfolio manager I've 
ever known loves to find a sector with wind at it's back..the early 
users of the "CrackBerry" knew (Nasdaq: RIMM) was the stock

one. This phenomena doesn't occur often and RIMM"s are as rare as

Kids Sneakers That Know Where They Are 
Castro Valley Forum - CA, USA - By : Michael Singer: 10/16/07 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 018183 
There is a trend in high-tech that recommends adding location-based services to anything and 
everything. But it has me pulled between wanting to see really cool gadgets and avoiding a Big 
Brother-like society. 
The latest is a new high-tech tennis shoe coming to the market that lets parents and guardians track 
the movements of their family using Global Positioning Systems or GPS technology. 
Called the "Smart Shoe," the miniature device is inserted in the sole of the low-top sneaker. An 
antenna that runs up the back of the footwear communicates with satellites and relays a location 
back to a subscription Web site service for easy viewing. Los Angeles-based GTXC, which makes 
the devices and the service, said it is hoping to put Smart Shoes in stores by the end of the year. 
Shoes with the technology could cost between $100 and $200. The tracking service is expected to 
cost about $20 a month.

Today's technology makes it easier for parents to know where their kids are and what they're

By Joe Burris 1Baltimore Sun July 1, 2007 
Michelle Smith had been reluctant to buy a cell phone for her 7-year-old daughter, Daysha. Then 
one day in April, a substitute teacher placed the Radford, Va., girl on the wrong school bus. 
Instead of being dropped off at her older sister's after-school program as planned, Daysha was sent 
home - only to find the doors locked. 
As she sat on her front porch crying, her mother drove around town, searching frantically for the 
girl. No one at the school could tell her which bus the girl had been put on. 
"Then my next-door neighbor called," said Smith, "and said, 'I have your baby.'" 
The scary moment had a happy ending, but Smith didn't want to take a chance on losing her 
daughter again. So she did what many other parents are doing - she bought her child a cell phone 
equipped with an electronic device that could keep track of her whereabouts.

M2M technology providers and system integrators often cite efficiency improvements and new 
revenue opportunities as common indicators of return-on-investment. However, as more and more 
customers use machine-to-machine applications to collect data, security has not only become a 
top-notch priority for end users and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) but also a highly 
valued part of fostering a positive ROI. 
According to IDC Corp., www.idc.com, Framingham, Mass., as devices enabling a mobile 
workforce continue to shrink in size, the increased likelihood of losing devices, such as laptops, 
mobile phones, BlackBerrys, has caused growing concern over the sensitive corporate information

Where would you be without GPS? 
Perhaps carrying fewer gadgets: The technology is being added to shoes, MP3 players, dogs 
By Carolyn Y. Johnson Boston Globe 1February 19, 2007 
This month, GTX Corp. launched a line of Xplorer Smart GPS shoes that transform sneakers into 
a wearable LoJack system. 
ABI Research found that the number of people in North America who subscribe to GPS-enabled 
location-based services more than doubled between 2005 and 2006, from 1.6 to 3.9 million. The 
number of subscribers is projected to rocket to 52 million in 2011. 
That means companies working in what used to be a niche market have been enjoying explosive 
growth. Revenues at TomTom NV, a Concord-based maker of personal navigation products, have 
increased more than 500-fold since 2001, from $2.5 million to an estimated $1.7 billion last 
year. Garmin's business has exploded into the mainstream, too, and the company ran its first 
Super Bowl ad this year. Boston-based start-up Skyhook Wireless brings location awareness to 
any device with WiFi, and announced a major partnership this month with GPS platform maker 
SiRF.

in real-time to their monitoring center and made available via intemet or phone. Predetermined 
geographic areas can also be defined and alerts sent when the person being tracked leaves or enters 
the area. And don't worry, they already have a product for outdoor activities called the Wearable

easily monitor the location of their charges.

phone alerts if a perimeter is breached by the wearer. This is handled by what the company calls 
its 'set-it-and-forget-it' Dual GeoFencing feature.

Do you know what the Most Innovative Location Device is? 
No it's not a compass or an astrolabe. It's not semaphore or a smoke signal. Not an RFID tag or a 
neon sign or phosphorous flare either. 
Give up? 
It's the GPS Smart ShoeTM recently mentioned in Forbes Magazine, developed by GTX Corp 
(OTCBB: GTX0.0B) and licensed to Aetrex Worldwide. Yes, a shoe. .well a very smart shoe as 
it can tell a caregiver the precise location, bearing, history, speed and altitude of an Alzheimer's 
victim that has eloped or wandered. No small feat — pun intended — to reduce the overwhelming 
stress on the millions of victim caregivers while potentially saving thousands from injuries and 
death owing to exposure, accidents and criminal activity. The GPS Shoe also reduces the 
manpower drain on municipal services; fire, police and welfare agencies often enlisted to locate 
the mentally ill. 
While a Finalist in the Most Innovative Location Device category of the Locations & Beyond 
Summit and the People's Choice Awards is a wonderful acknowledgment for the years GTXO 
invested in developing the solution and the promise that Aetrex has made in bringing the Shoe to 
market... the real winners are those touched by this devastating disease for which there is no cure, 
but now have a new measure of hope.

Keeping an eye on Mom and Dad 
Remote monitoring technology aims to keep seniors in their houses and out of nursing homes ____ 
Over the coming months a raft of new-and-improved remote monitoring devices will hit the _____ 
market, from GPS shoes that can track the whereabouts of wandering seniors to MedCottages, 
portable RV-like units equipped with motion and monitoring systems that allow seniors to 
maintain some independence from the backyard of their adult childrens' homes. 
"As we age, this is going to be a growing trend," says Laurie Orlov, a Florida-based expert on so-
called "aging-in-place technology" aimed at keeping seniors in their houses and out of nursing 
homes as long as possible. 
"We have to get past the fear and antagonism among the older people who need it the most. I don't 
think they're that technology-ready, but the boomers, who are their adult children, certainly are." 
Motion sensors strategically placed in the three-bedroom home where Howe has lived for 53 years 
feed information right to her daughter's laptop, detailing when she got out of bed (the Friday we 
chatted it was 9 a.m.), walked into the bathroom (9:15 a.m.) or hovered at the kitchen table where 
she keeps her pills (9:30 a.m.) 
Even her blood-pressure reading (165/76) is fed to her daughter's computer, along with her daily 
weigh-in tally, providing a detailed graph which she often takes to her doctor appointments. 
The only thing GrandCare can't tell Pierce, because her system doesn't include cameras, is if her 
mother actually swallowed her pills. 
Monitoring and in-home help technologies will be a $20 billion U.S. business in North America by 
2020, predicts Orlov, founder of Aging In Place Technology Watch. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032081 
Already some baby boomers are able to remotely lock their parents' doors, track calls coming into 
their homes and even see who is ringing the doorbell, in many cases right from their smart phones. 
Systems such as QuietCare, WellAWARE, FineThanx and SimplyHome are already fixtures in 
some U.S. homes and seniors' communities, although Orlov estimates fewer than 10,000 units are 
in active use because the systems can be so costly. 
Next month, Paul Whyte, a Markham dealer of smart-home technology that allows ordinary 
electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, will unveil the GrandCare system at 
the Zoomer show in Toronto. 
"I call it the invisible caregiver," says Whyte of Cybernetics Systems Inc. "The minute I saw this 
system I thought, 'There's something that actually makes sense.' 
The key, of course, with all these technologies is that the senior be relatively able-bodied and 
sound of mind — most are of limited value if the senior is suffering from dementia, which is 
expected to become a major public health issue in the next few decades. 
But developers are also working hard on that challenging front. 
Sometime later this fall or next spring the first GPS-equipped shoe, the Aetrex Ambulator, will go 
on sale through www.gpsshoe.com orwww.foot.com. 
Originally designed for children by Los Angeles-based GTX Corp., the new shoes are expected to 
retail for about $250 U.S. They enable caregivers to track those afflicted with dementia or 
Alzheimer's thanks to GPS and cellular technology that will relay their whereabouts back to a 
monitoring centre. 
"Privacy may be a talking point, but it's not really an issue," says Patrick Bertagna, chairman and 
CEO of GTX Corp. 
MEDCottage creator Dupin expects concerns around privacy will fade quickly as families and 
health-care systems here and in the U.S. become overwhelmed by aging baby boomers — more 
than 76 million in the U.S., 10 million in Canada — who start hitting 65 next year. 
"I see remote monitoring becoming an integral part of health care as we all age," says Dupin. "One 
of the issues around aging in place is going to be making trade-offs. Privacy may be something we 
have to give up."

Tracking Deal 
A downtown L.A. company that creates GPS tracking applications for cell phones has

The deal could mean more than 40 million more downloads, which would translate to increased 
revenue, for GTX Corp.'s application, which is currently available for the iPhone, BlackBerry and 
Android phones, said GTX Chief Executive Patrick Bertagna. 
The LociMobile tracking applications send a GPS signal out to all of a person's cell phone 
contacts who use the app. Bertagna said the app can be used to meet up with friends or keep tabs 
on kids. 
GTX has also developed a GPS shoe for tracking Alzheimer's patients.

Resources and Technology to Help Caregivers Cope 
Kirk Johnson - NYTimes.com - May 4, 2010 - One Alzheimer's wanderer in Arizona had lost 
much of his memory, but not, apparently, his interest in fashion: he never left the house without a 
beloved baseball cap on his head. So a trick the family used to keep the man around was to hide 
his caps. 
Search-and-rescue experts who deal with dementia patients also recommend alarms on doors that 
sound when opened if a proper code is not entered, along with posters or wallpaper images that 
disguise or conceal doors. Sometimes a simple large, emphatic sign on every door saying "Stop!" 
will deter a wanderer.

New App craze brings back the 1990's 
World Market Media - April 9, 2010 - Every Portfolio manager I've

he/she needed to invest in because every person on Wall Street had 
one. This phenomena doesn't occur often and RIMM"s are as rare as

lightning quick revenues based on the size of the market itself.

Kids Sneakers That Know Where They Are 
Castro Valley Forum - CA, USA - By : Michael Singer: 10/16/07 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032093 
There is a trend in high-tech that recommends adding location-based services to anything and 
everything. But it has me pulled between wanting to see really cool gadgets and avoiding a Big 
Brother-like society. 
The latest is a new high-tech tennis shoe coming to the market that lets parents and guardians track 
the movements of their family using Global Positioning Systems or GPS technology. 
Called the "Smart Shoe," the miniature device is inserted in the sole of the low-top sneaker. An 
antenna that runs up the back of the footwear communicates with satellites and relays a location 
back to a subscription Web site service for easy viewing. Los Angeles-based GTXC, which makes 
the devices and the service, said it is hoping to put Smart Shoes in stores by the end of the year. 
Shoes with the technology could cost between $100 and $200. The tracking service is expected to 
cost about $20 a month.

one day in April, a substitute teacher placed the Radford, Va., girl on the wrong school bus. 
Instead of being dropped off at her older sister's after-school program as planned, Daysha was sent 
home - only to find the doors locked. 
As she sat on her front porch crying, her mother drove around town, searching frantically for the 
girl. No one at the school could tell her which bus the girl had been put on. 
"Then my next-door neighbor called," said Smith, "and said, 'I have your baby.'" 
The scary moment had a happy ending, but Smith didn't want to take a chance on losing her 
daughter again. So she did what many other parents are doing - she bought her child a cell phone 
equipped with an electronic device that could keep track of her whereabouts.

GPS technology will soon be at your feet, offering peace of mind to loved ones of Alzheimer's 
sufferers, people with autism, active preschoolers and others who might wander into harm's way 
or get lost. 
A Los Angeles-based company that sees opportunity in the merging of GPS tracking technology 
and footwear, has developed several prototypes of GPS tennis shoes. 
GTX Corporation is having discussions with various footwear manufactures (including some in 
Oregon) about licensing its technological designs and connectivity system. 
During a recent visit to Portland, GTX Corp CEO Patrick Bertagna showed KGW a prototype of 
the company's GPS shoe.

Mobile Ways to Keep Track of Your Kids 
By Lori Tucker, (WATE) Knoxville, TN -- June 7, 2007 
As technology makes our society more mobile, there are more mobile ways to keep track of your 
loved ones including cell phones, car trackers and even shoes. GPS shoes That's right, an LA 
company has patented a GPS system in a shoe. 
Xplorer Smart Shoes, made by GTX Corp., are able to track the person wearing them in real time 
or by remote surveillance. 
GTX says the shoes work particularly well for: children, people with Alzheimer's disease, outdoor 
adventures, military, police, fire and public safety workers. 
IN THE PIPELINE: Tracking All The Uses For Positioning Chips 
By Donna Fuscaldo - DowJones Newswire - May 1, 2007 
For Patrick Bertagna, the eureka moment came a few years ago when watching the coverage of the 
Elizabeth Smart abduction. After spending years helping companies track their products via 
software, Bertagna decided it was time to do something that mattered. 
So the serial entrepreneur, armed with a couple of checks from friends, launched Global Trek 
Xploration Corp., a Los Angeles-based company that's developing shoes embedded with a global 
positioning chip. The shoes will enable parents to monitor their children's every movement and 
caregivers to keep real time tabs on elderly or sick people.

Top-Notch Security 
M2M - Specialty Publications - April 6, 2007 
M2M technology providers and system integrators often cite efficiency improvements and new 
revenue opportunities as common indicators of return-on-investment. However, as more and more 
customers use machine-to-machine applications to collect data, security has not only become a 
top-notch priority for end users and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) but also a highly 
valued part of fostering a positive ROI. 
According to IDC Corp., www.idc.com, Framingham, Mass., as devices enabling a mobile 
workforce continue to shrink in size, the increased likelihood of losing devices, such as laptops, 
mobile phones, BlackBerrys, has caused growing concern over the sensitive corporate information 
they contain. 
Smart Shoes Get Smarter 
M2M - Specialty Publications - April 2, 2007

system) shoes from Global Trek Xploration Corp. (GTXC), www.gtxcorp.com, Los Angeles, 
Calif., will now be equipped with wireless and location modules from Enfora 
Inc.,www.enfora.com, Plano, Texas. 
GTXC chose Enfora's Enabler IIG-A-GPS modules for its robust and accurate platform, company 
executive say. Eric Stalnaker vice president of business development at GTXC explains, "Enfora 
and the Enabler II provide us with an integrated approach to software, Internet connectivity, and

Few at conference get to soul of GPS shoe 
Satellite tracking services were expected to be one of the big attractions at this year's big wireless 
conference in Orlando, but the satellite shoe seemed to surprise most of the people walking around 
the convention floor. 
Many passers-by Wednesday furrowed their brows or shook their heads at what appeared to be a 
silly toy for spoiled yuppie joggers. Only a few investigated long enough to realize that the GPS

shoe may well be one of the least frivolous prototypes on display among the 1,100 
exhibitors. Developers plan to sell the device as a way to track mentally disabled people or 
seniors who have Alzheimer's disease. 
Where would you be without GPS? 
Perhaps carrying fewer gadgets: The technology is being added to shoes, MP3 players, dogs 
By Carolyn Y. Johnson Boston Globe 1February 19, 2007 
This month, GTX Corp. launched a line of Xplorer Smart GPS shoes that transform sneakers into 
a wearable LoJack system. 
ABI Research found that the number of people in North America who subscribe to GPS-enabled 
location-based services more than doubled between 2005 and 2006, from 1.6 to 3.9 million. The 
number of subscribers is projected to rocket to 52 million in 2011. 
That means companies working in what used to be a niche market have been enjoying explosive 
growth. Revenues at TomTom NV, a Concord-based maker of personal navigation products, have 
increased more than 500-fold since 2001, from $2.5 million to an estimated $1.7 billion last 
year. Garmin's business has exploded into the mainstream, too, and the company ran its first 
Super Bowl ad this year. Boston-based start-up Skyhook Wireless brings location awareness to 
any device with WiFi, and announced a major partnership this month with GPS platform maker 
SiRF. 
Xplorer shoes offer advanced personal location services 
from Wearable Electronics 
January 29, 2007 - We've written several times about the concept of electronically fencing dogs 
and cats for their safety, or the safety of others. Similarly, as GPS technologies have become 
commercially viable, of tracking assets and loved ones to ensure their safety. Now personal 
location services company GTXC Corporation, is set to unveil a line of Xplorer Smart GPS shoes 
at the World Shoe Association (WSA) in Las Vegas on February 1 which offer a range of new 
opportunities. Xplorer shoes incorporate a small and robust GPS tracking device which hooks up 
with GTXC's intemet user portal to offer a very compelling array of personal location services. 
Integrated GPS Shoes by GTXC

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032097 
Integrated GPS Shoes by GTXC Though originally made to track patients and kids, we're sure the 
shoes will be integrated soon with the Nike + Ipod so you can track your run in your personal 
Google mashup. Or hide it in your wife's purse to see whether she's banging San Francisco's 
mayor, Gavin Newsom. Or something like that. The system from GTXC has a sophisticated GPS 
integrated into the shoe, which communicates directly with a satellite, which then relays locations 
in real-time to their monitoring center and made available via intemet or phone. Predetermined 
geographic areas can also be defined and alerts sent when the person being tracked leaves or enters 
the area. And don't worry, they already have a product for outdoor activities called the Wearable 
Caddy. 
New Smart GPS Shoes 
Manisha Kanetkar - Thursday, 1 February 2007 
Keeping track of your loved ones has never been so easy (or so spy-like) with the new Xplorer 
smart GPS shoes designed by GTXC. 
The company boasts the shoes incorporate the smallest, most powerful and robust GPS tracking 
device currently available. GTXC says they are ideal for caretakers of children or the elderly to 
easily monitor the location of their charges. 
So, for example, they can preset perimeters of safe zones or unsafe zones, and then receive mobile 
phone alerts if a perimeter is breached by the wearer. This is handled by what the company calls 
its 'set-it-and-forget-it' Dual GeoFencing feature.

Israel Policy Forum 
On Iran: How to Repair the Widening American-Israeli Rift 
Ephraim Sneh 
The Islamist takeover in the Middle East and North Africa has created perilous strategic 
turbulence in the region. Consequently, it is now critically important that the United States and 
its few allies cooperate closely. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in recent weeks for US-
Israel relations regarding Iran's nuclear program. The disagreement about attacking Iran's 
nuclear facilities has turned into ugly bickering, much of it disguised. This is harmful for both 
Israel and the United States. 
To heal this rift — which is necessary to effectively address the Iranian threat — we must 
understand the following basic facts: 
1. The Israeli fear of a nuclear Iran is genuine. It is not a political trick of Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu or Defense Minister Ehud Barak. A nuclear Iran would bolster and 
encourage extremist militant forces across the region. The moderates would be discouraged, 
intimidated and invariably weakened to the point where they would be unable to negotiate with 
Israel. In just a few years, Israel will be surrounded by three Pakistan-like' countries: Saudi 
Arabia, Egypt and Turkey. All three would possess nuclear weapons and be dominated 
politically by Islamists. In such a scenario, Israel would lose its strategic advantage in the region. 
It would lose its lead as a country of entrepreneurship and excellence, as foreign investment 
would decline and talented young Israelis would build their future abroad. No responsible Israeli 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 027099 
leader will allow such a nightmare to become a reality. The hateful declarations of Iran's leaders, 
committed to wiping the Jewish state off the map, do not assuage Israelis' fears. 
2. Economic sanctions cannot convince the regime in Teheran to abandon its nuclear project. 
However, sanctions can bring about the collapse of the regime if they are vigorously 
implemented and enforced. 
3. An American military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities would be more effective 
than an Israeli one. But disparaging Israel's capabilities and its military ingenuity, undermining 
its deterrence effect, is a grave mistake. 
4. Israel's operational window is closing. If Israel has to cope alone with the Iranian threat, its 
window of operational opportunity is narrower than the American one. It has to act sooner. 
5. An Israeli military strike in the next two months, contravening repeated demands by the 
U.S. President to postpone it, would be counterproductive. The damage of defying the 
President would be greater than the damage sustained by allowing the Iranian regime an 
additional few months of advancing toward acquiring the bomb. Such a strike may broaden the 
gap between the U.S. and Israel and weaken the alliance, which all previous Israeli Prime-
Ministers have safeguarded as a strategic asset of Israel. 
6. The United States has failed to prevent countries like Pakistan or North Korea from 
obtaining nuclear weapons. This record feeds Israeli skepticism about a U.S. success in the 
case of Iran. This skepticism prevails despite the clear rhetoric and unquestionable commitments 
of the President and the Secretaries of State and Defense to prevent a nuclear Iran. 
7. The fact that the Israeli Prime Minister and the Republican presidential candidate share 
the same political benefactor feeds suspicions in the Obama administration about Netanyahu's 
motives for attacking Iran a few weeks before the U.S. presidential elections. 
8. The regional perspective cannot continue ignoring the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. This issue can no longer be swept under the rug. Maintaining the status quo is politically 
comfortable in the short-run, but it will be combustible and devastating in the long run. 
Achieving the two-state solution will preserve Israel as a Jewish, democratic state. It will end 
Israel's regional isolation. It will rebuild America's standing and influence in the Arab and 
Muslim world. Furthermore, these last two outcomes will strengthen America's and Israel's 
hands in thwarting Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. 
These eight basic facts combine to produce a complex reality. When fully understood, they can 
pave the way to restoring U.S.-Israeli harmony. There is no symmetry between the United States, 
the super-power, and its tiny ally, Israel. But the "package" required from each side in order to 
mend fences has to include the following mutual commitments: 
1. Israel will not attack Iran in 2012. 
2. The United States will hold a joint intelligence estimate session with Israel in the early spring 
of 2013. If the conclusion of this joint estimate is that there is no substantial slow-down of the 
Iranian nuclear project, the U.S. will take military action to destroy this project. 
3. The United States will oppose any attempt to intervene in Israel's strategic capacities and will 
prevent any monitoring of Israel's own strategic installations. At the same time, the United States 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 027100 
will uncompromisingly support Israel's right to preserve and develop its indigenous military 
capacities. 
4. Israel will accept an American invitation to attend a peace conference that will be convened 
in the U.S. no later than mid-2013. This gathering will address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
aiming to resolve it once and for all with an agreed-upon timetable for implementation. 
These four commitments would serve the interests of both the United States and Israel. They 
would enable the U.S. to resume its leadership role of peacemaking in the Middle East. And they 
would provide a basis for binding the U.S. and Israel together as they face these challenging 
times.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved Praluent, a new medicine to lower cholesterol in people who 
have established heart disease, for people whose risk of a heart attack or stroke is not being adequately 
controlled by existing drugs called statins. 
It might be a big step in the battle against heart disease — and the approval is a triumph for Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, the Tarrytown, N.Y.-based biotechnology company that invented it. Praluent is likely to be 
more widely used, and to cost more, than Wall Steet analysts expected. That also means it could be a big cost 
down the line. 
"Obviously, the class is one of the biggest developments in cardiology in the last decade, that will allow us to 
treat patients who have been extremely difficult to treat with high levels of LDL cholesterol," says Steven 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025888 
Nissen, chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. "It's very promising." 
But it will also be very expensive, say Troy Brennan, the chief medical officer of CVS Caremark, the giant 
pharmacy benefits manager."If these drugs are used as broadly as they could be used, they are going to be by far 
the most expensive drug class," Brennan says. 
Praluent, an injection, lowers low-density lipoprotein, the so-called "bad cholesterol", by as much as 60%, far 
more than the statin drugs alone. It is the first drug to work by targeting a protein called PCSK9. Mutations in 
the gene that makes it can result in patients having lower cholesterol and a dramatically lower lifetime risk of 
heart attacks. A rival medicine from Amgen is also expected to be approved soon. The FDA is clearing Praluent 
for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes high cholesterol, 
and for people who have heart disease, like those who've had heart attacks or strokes, who are already taking 
the maximum dose of a statin they can tolerate. 
Regeneron and its marketing partner Sanofi say Praluent will have a wholesale cost of $40 a day, or $14,600 a 
year, for either of two doses, 75 milligrams or 150 mgs. It's likely that insurance companies will get a 
significant discount, because Amgen and Regeneron will compete by giving the insurers rebates.

Donald Trump And The Decline Of American Character--A Cautionary Tale 
"We don't want the noise about these drugs to be price," says Leonard Schleifer, the chief executive and 
founder of Regeneron. "We have to make sure that people get access to the drug for a fair price if they're 
insured, for free if they're not insured, or at a discount if they're under-insured." 
Praluent's price is 46% higher than that forecast by Evercore ISI, an investment bank, and it is being approved 
for a larger group of patients than many Wall Street analysts expected following a meeting convened by the 
FDA to analyze the data on the drug. Some doctors argued its use should be restricted mainly to patients with 
FH. But Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI's pharmaceutical analyst, says that investors were initially 
disappointed because they had hoped the FDA would greenlight the drug for an even broader group. Regeneron 
shares were down 2.5% in afternoon trading before they were halted pending news. 
But doctors may prescribe the drug more widely than the label suggests. A survey of physicians published this 
morning by Geoffrey Porges, an biotechnology analyst at investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein, found that they 
would use the drug in 30% to 40% of patients who had already had heart attacks. He wrote that 2020 sales of 
Praluent could be as high as $4.8 billion. 
In the survey, doctors expressed a preference for Praluent. One advantage of Regeneron's drug is that doctors 
will be able to start it at a lower, 75 milligram dose. 
Schleifer, who is a medical doctor and, incidentally, a billionaire thanks to his Regeneron stake, says that the 
company expects that as many as 8 million people who don't have their cholesterol well-controlled could be 
candidates for Praluent. He emphasized, though, that until larger studies prove the drug prevents heart attacks 
and strokes patients should always choose statins first. It will have sales representatives a 
Insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, who help insurers and employers manage drug costs, are 
going to do their best to restrict use of Praluent, though. Brennan, the CVS Caremark executive, says that he 
expects patients will need to have medical records documenting that they have already taken statins. Those not 
taking statins would need a blood test confirming that a statin caused elevations in muscle or liver enzymes, not 
just complaints that they were achy. "We're not trying to replace statins," says Schliefer, the Regeneron CEO. 
Most people who have muscle problems from statins do not have those elevated muscle enzymes, says Nissen, 
the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist, who is conducting a clinical trial Amgen and Pfizer, which is also developing 
a similar cholesterol drug. He says he has patients who are "desperate" to take a statin but who cannot tolerate 
it because of muscle pain but do not have elevated muscle enzymes. 
"Dehspite significant progress over the last decades, high cholesterol remains a leading concern in the U.S. and 
globally," said Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. "Praluent demonstrates the power of 
the Sanofi and Regeneron alliance to deliver a first-in-class therapy in the U.S. for patients in need. Sanofi has a 
strong cardiovascular heritage and dedication to these patients, and we look forward to working with other 
regulatory authorities to make Praluent available to patients worldwide." 
"We are grateful to the thousands of patients and investigators worldwide who participated in the ODYSSEY 
clinical trial program," said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer, 
Regeneron. "Praluent represents the culmination of more than a decade of tireless work to translate the genetic-
based discovery of PCSK9 into an innovative medicine that brings meaningful value to patients." 
The approval of Praluent was based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 ODYSSEY program, which showed 
consistent, positive results compared to placebo, which included current standard of care therapy (statins). In the 
ODYSSEY LONG TERM trial which evaluated Praluent 150 mg every two weeks, Praluent reduced LDL 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025890 
cholesterol by 58 percent versus placebo at week 24 when added to current standard of care, including 
maximally tolerated statins. In ODYSSEY COMBO I, Praluent 75 mg every two weeks as an adjunct to statins 
reduced LDL cholesterol by an additional 46 percent compared to placebo at week 12. At week 24 in the same 
trial, Praluent reduced LDL cholesterol by 43 percent compared to placebo. In this study, if additional LDL 
cholesterol lowering was required based on pre-specified criteria at week 8, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg 
at week 12 for the remainder of the trial. Eighty-three percent of patients remained on their initial 75 mg dose. 
Praluent is generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Local injection site reactions including 
redness, itching, swelling or pain/tenderness where the injection is given were the most common events (7.2 
percent with Praluent versus 5.1 percent with placebo) and resulted in a low discontinuation rate that was 
comparable to placebo (0.2 percent with Praluent versus 0.4 percent with placebo). Patients receiving Praluent 
had a greater number of injection site reactions, had more reports of associated symptoms, and had reactions of 
longer average duration than patients receiving placebo. Other common adverse events occurring more 
frequently in patients with Praluent than placebo included symptoms of the common cold and flu or flu-like 
symptoms. 
The companies carefully considered the potential medical value that Praluent offers patients in determining the 
Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC). The U.S. WAC price of Praluent is $40 per day ($1,120 every 28 days) for 
both the 75 mg and 150 mg doses, making Praluent the lowest priced patient-administered monoclonal antibody 
therapy on an annualized basis. Actual costs to patients, payers and health systems are anticipated to be lower as 
WAC pricing does not reflect discounts or rebates. Out-of-pocket costs to patients will vary depending on 
insurance status and eligibility for patient assistance. 
Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Praluent are able 
to access the medicine and receive the support they may need. The companies will launch a comprehensive 
program that offers support, training and follow up for patients at every step of the process. The program will 
provide patient assistance to uninsured or underinsured patients, including providing free medicine to eligible 
patients, and can help identify coverage options for out-of-pocket costs. Additional services include educational 
information, clinical support for physicians, nurses and pharmacists, as well as reimbursement services, 
including co-pay support for eligible patients and information about insurance eligibility support. For more 
information, please call 1-844-PRALUENT (1-844-772-5836 
). 
Earlier today, the companies announced that the European Medicine Agency's (EMA's) Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of 
Praluent, recommending its approval for use in certain adult patients with hypercholesterolemia. The European 
Commission (EC) is expected to make a final decision on the Marketing Authorization Application for Praluent 
in the European Union in September 2015. 
Investor Relations Conference Call on Praluent 
Sanofi and Regeneron will be hosting a conference call for the financial community on Praluent® (alirocumab) 
Injection for the treatment of high LDL cholesterol in adult patients. The conference call will take place on

ODYSSEY Program 
The ODYSSEY Phase 3 program is one of the most comprehensive clinical trial programs ever conducted for 
an investigational LDL cholesterol lowering therapy. The program includes 14 global Phase 3 trials evaluating 
more than 23,500 patients. The primary efficacy end point in all of the studies was the mean percent reduction 
from baseline in LDL cholesterol at week 24 compared to placebo (maximally tolerated statin therapy); all of 
the completed studies met their primary endpoint. A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved LDL 
cholesterol of less than 70 mg/dL in the Praluent group as compared to placebo at both week 12 and week 24. 
The ongoing ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial will prospectively evaluate the cardiovascular benefits of Praluent 
in approximately 18,000 patients. 
Important Safety Information 
Do not use PRALUENT if you are allergic to alirocumab or to any of the ingredients in PRALUENT. 
Before you start using PRALUENT, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including 
allergies, and if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. 
Tell your healthcare provider or pharmacist about any prescription and over-the-counter medicines you are 
taking or plan to take, including natural or herbal remedies. 
PRALUENT can cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions that can be severe and require treatment 
in a hospital. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have 
any symptoms of an allergic reaction including a severe rash, redness, severe itching, a swollen face or trouble 
breathing. 
The most common side effects of PRALUENT include: redness, itching, swelling, or pain/tenderness at the 
injection site, symptoms of the common cold, and flu or flu-like symptoms. Tell your healthcare provider if 
you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

Fareed Zakaria: Trump sells America short 
Dear Donald Trump: China, Japan and Mexico are not "killing us" 
By Fareed Zakaria, Thursday, September 17, 2015 
Donald Trump's presidential bid is centered on the promise of his personal talents. He says he's the "most successful 
person ever to run for the presidency, by far." (George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower, sit down!) But if there is an 
idea animating his candidacy, it is that the United States is being badly beaten by its economic competitors. In his speech 
on foreign policy this week, Trump explained that America is being bested by countries such as China, Japan and Mexico 
because their leaders are "smarter, more cunning and sharper than our leaders." "They're killing us," he often says. 
This is an odd moment to make these charges because the reality is almost entirely the opposite. The United States is 
more dominant on the global economic landscape than at any point since the heyday of Bill Clinton's presidency — 
perhaps even more so. 
Last quarter, the U.S. economy grew at a 3.7 percent clip. Annual growth now is almost twice that of Europe and four 
times that of Japan. Unemployment is at 5.1 percent, the lowest in seven years. The deficit as a percentage of gross 
domestic product (2.8 percent in 2014) is at its lowest since 2007. 
"The U.S. has come out of the 2008 crisis better than all the others," says Ruchir Sharma, head of global macro investing 
at Morgan Stanley. "Americans have reduced their debt burden more than the Europeans, while China's debt has 
skyrocketed to extremely dangerous levels. If you look outside of China, U.S. growth is actually faster even than the 
emerging markets. Since the 2008 crisis, U.S. equity markets have outperformed all others — in fact 9 out of the 10 most 
valuable companies in the world are now American. The dollar is the currency of choice. Global growth is not what it 
used to be, but in a bad neighborhood, the U.S. has the best house by far." Sharma points out that for the past four 
years, the United States' share of global GDP has increased while Europe's and Japan's have moved down. 
When I was in Europe last week, businessmen there were concerned with what they saw as a new level of U.S. 
dominance in everything from technology to entertainment to finance. Consider America's big banks. They were at the 
epicenter of the financial crisis and were badly battered by it. Since then, bankers have complained that they've faced 
uncertainty about government policies, overzealous regulators trying to compensate for their laxness before the crisis 
and the unwieldy burdens of the Dodd-Frank law. 
Well, U.S. banks today are more dominant than ever. The Wall Street Journal notes that in the past five years, JPMorgan 
Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have increased in value by $254.6 billion. In the 
same period, their European competitors, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland added 
just $9.5 billion. In July, Barclays Chairman John McFarlane was asked if America's banks were eating European lenders' 
lunch. He replied: "They are doing a good job of it." He added that the U.S. banks "are the only ones that really claim to 
be global and successful."

To compare the United States' performance and leadership to Mexico's, Japan's and China's is particularly ill-timed. 
Trump might be stuck in a 1980s time warp on Japan. When his "The Art of the Deal" was published in 1987, Americans 
were envious of Japan's brilliant leaders, who were said to be outsmarting the United States at every turn. Since then, 
Japan has become the poster child for economic stagnation and political paralysis. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been 
unwilling or unable to get his promised reforms enacted, and the country's economy continues to shrink. 
Mexico is watching its growth collapse. While its president, Enrique Pena Nieto, is a courageous and intelligent leader 
who has made some very bold decisions, he has also made some significant missteps. Most important, the country was 
ill-prepared for plunging oil prices that have battered government revenues and growth. 
China has had three decades of supercharged growth and competent government policy. But in the past few years, 
Beijing went on a borrowing binge, running up its total debt to levels that are unprecedented, according to Sharma. And 
in the past two months it has made mistakes in managing both its equity markets and currency — mistakes that have 
cost $400 billion, the Financial Times reports. 
Of course, the United States has problems that are worrying, such as wage stagnation and low labor-force participation. 
But the important comparison is not to some ideal fantasy of what America might be but to other countries in the real 
world. And the facts show, Mr. Trump, we're killing them.

Fareed Zakaria: Trump sells America short 
Dear Donald Trump: China, Japan and Mexico are not "killing us" 
By Fareed Zakaria, Thursday, September 17, 2015 
Donald Trump's presidential bid is centered on the promise of his personal talents. He says he's the "most successful 
person ever to run for the presidency, by far." (George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower, sit down!) But if there is an 
idea animating his candidacy, it is that the United States is being badly beaten by its economic competitors. In his speech

because their leaders are "smarter, more cunning and sharper than our leaders." "They're killing us," he often says.

Donald Trump says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia 
Clinton attacks Trump's foreign policy as 'dangerously incoherent' 1 / 27U.S. Democratic presidential candidate 
Hillary Clinton lambasted Donald Trump's foreign policy platform as "dangerously incoherent" in a speech on 
Thursday that cast her Republican rival as both a dangerous and laughable figure. 
A former U.S. secretary of state, Clinton attacked Trump for his policies and his character, suggesting Trump 
might start a nuclear war if elected to the White House simply because "someone got under his very thin skin." 
"Donald Trump's ideas are not just different, they are dangerously incoherent," she said to a room of supporters 
in San Diego, California. "They're not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and 
outright lies." 
____0 Mike Blake U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton delivers a speech on national 
security in San Diego, California, United States June 2, 2016. 
Clinton, the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee, delivered her speech as 
she seeks to shift her attention to the Nov. 8 election against likely rival Trump and away from Bernie Sanders, 
a U.S. senator from Vermont, who is continuing his longshot bid for the nomination. 
Trump, the Republicans' presumptive nominee, has said he would sit down with North Korean leader Kim Jong 
Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program and has criticized the decades-old NATO alliance with mainly 
European nations as obsolete and too costly for the United States. 
Clinton derided these and other positions, promising she would do a better job keeping the United States safe 
and standing in front of a backdrop of 19 large U.S. flags, an unusual abundance even by the standards of 
presidential campaign events. 
Trump, a billionaire businessman who has never held elected office or worked in government before, says he 
has experience dealing with foreign governments through setting up hotels, resorts, golf courses and beauty 
pageants in foreign countries. Clinton, who is also a former U.S. senator and former first lady, mocked this. 
"He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia," she said to loud 
laughter. 
Trump has talked tough on foreign policy. He has said he would bring back waterboarding and other brutal 
interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects that are widely regarded as torture and were discontinued by 
Democratic President Barack Obama. 
He has also vowed to renegotiate trade deals, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, and 
said he would ask members of the 28-nation NATO alliance to "pay up" or "get out." 
Trump has criticized Clinton for her handling of foreign policy during her 2009-2013 stint as foreign secretary, 
including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that 
killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. 
He cites Clinton's support for the Iraq war - launched by former Republican President George W. Bush - as 
another example of her shortcomings. 
At a rally Wednesday night in Sacramento, California, Trump said he had seen a copy of Clinton's speech and 
"it was such lies about my foreign policy."

Steve Bannon's clever idea to save the GOP from brutal midterms 
By Fareed Zakaria, Friday, June 1, 2018 
ROME -- The Republican Party faces dim prospects in the midterm elections. But it doesn't have to be that way, says 
Stephen K. Bannon, the chief ideologist of the populist wave that brought Donald Trump into the White House. "If the 
Republicans continue on the path they are on," Bannon told me Thursday, "they will lose 40 seats in the House and 
President Trump will be impeached." He presented an alternative that strikes me as clever, and it's a strategy that 
Trump himself seems to instinctively get. 
Bannon was in Rome to learn from and provide support to the unusual coalition of populists and nationalists who 
together won half the vote in Italy's recent elections and are now set to govern. Bannon sees that sort of coalition — 
mixing left and right, old and young — as his goal for the United States. "Europe is about a year ahead of the United 
States.... You see populist-nationalist movements with reform [here].... You could begin to see the elements of 
Bernie Sanders coupled with the Trump movement that really becomes a dominant political force in American politics." 
(This column draws on an on-air interview he did with me for CNN, as well as a subsequent conversation.) 
The Republican Party's strategy, for now, appears to be to make the midterm elections a series of local contests focusing 
on the tax cut and the healthy economy. Bannon views this as fundamentally misguided. "You have to nationalize the 
election," he said. Bannon understands that voters are moved from the gut more than through a wonky analysis of 
taxes. "This is going to be an emotional [election] — you're either with [House Minority leader] Nancy Pelosi or you're 
with Donald Trump.... Trump's second presidential race will be on Nov. 6 of this year." 
Bannon is most focused on the issue of immigration because it hits both the heart and the head. "Immigration is about 
not just sovereignty, it's about jobs." He believes that the Trump coalition can attract up to a third of Sanders supporters 
who see trade and immigration as having created unfair competition for jobs, particularly for working-class blacks and 
Hispanics. He advocates appealing directly to those voters, saying, "You're not going to be able to take the Hispanic and 
black community from the STEM system in grammar school to our best engineering schools ... to the great jobs in 
Silicon Valley, unless you start to limit these H-1B visas and this unfair competition ... from East Asia and South Asia." 
Now this strikes me as entirely wrong. The reason that not enough Hispanic and black students end up in Silicon Valley 
has much more to do with a broken education system, particularly for poorer kids, than the modest number of skilled 
Asian immigrants who get work visas. The most likely result of limiting these visas is that talented immigrants will simply 
go elsewhere — Canada, Britain, Australia — and start successful companies there. And, in fact, there is lots of evidence 
this is already happening.

But Bannon is right that this is a brilliant electoral strategy. The idea of greater immigration controls has an undeniable 
mainstream appeal. The Democratic Party is too far to the left on many of these issues, embracing concepts such as 
sanctuary cities, which only reinforces its image as a party that is more concerned with race, identity and 
multiculturalism than the rule of law. 
Where Bannon is analytic and historical, Trump is instinctive. But the president appears to see the situation similarly. I 
wrote last month that Trump would try to fight the midterm elections on immigration and added, "Do not be surprised if 
Trump also picks a few fights with black athletes." In recent weeks, the president has labeled immigrant gang members 
"animals" and suggested that football players who silently protest police violence against blacks should leave the 
country. 
Bannon thinks Trump is just getting started in nationalizing the election around immigration. He predicted the next 
major battle would be over the proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. "The wall is not just totemic. The wall is 
absolutely central to his program.... As we come up on Sept. 30, if [Congress's] appropriations bill does not include 
spending to fully build his wall ... I believe he will shut down the government." 
Sadly, but not surprisingly, Bannon doesn't think the fighting and the rancor in the United States are going away any 
time soon. The "battle between nationalists and globalists is at the fundamental roots of what America is, what America 
will be," he said. "This is very healthy, and ... I think this is going to go on for a long time.... We've got a lot more 
fighting and a lot more scar tissue to go over."
