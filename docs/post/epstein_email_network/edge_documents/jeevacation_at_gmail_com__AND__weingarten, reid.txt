Subject: 
In taking his case to Washington, Mr. Aliyev has variously sought safe passage to the United States, help in 
recovering $2 billion that relatives claimed they lost from seized businesses, or at least the satisfaction of 
embarrassing Mr. Nazarbayev. For his part, the Kazakh leader wants to make sure that the Americans stay out 
of the dispute, and not allow it to affect their alliance with his government. 
The Obama administration has done just that. Through comments in secret diplomatic cables, the former 
ambassador to Kazakhstan made clear his wariness of being drawn in. 
"Both sides — the government and Aliyev — seek to manipulate us to their own advantage," Richard E. 
Hoagland, who ended his term as United States ambassador early this year, wrote in February 2009 in one of 
more than a dozen State Department cables obtained by the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks that mentioned the 
dispute. [*] 
Mr. Nazarbayev, 70, [*]a former steel worker and Soviet-era Communist Party leader, has been in power for 
two decades, presiding over Central Asia's most vibrant economy. Human rights activists, however, have 
long accused him of persecuting dissidents and political opponents. 
Mr. Aliyev, 48, [*]has served as chief of the tax police, deputy foreign affairs minister and head of the 
Kazakh equivalent of the K.G.B. But critics say he used his clout to secretly take over private companies for 
financial gain, often by threatening violence. 
Now hiding somewhere in Europe, he has been convicted back home on what he claims are trumped-up 
criminal charges, including a coup attempt. His wife divorced him in June 2007, and the Kazakh government 
has taken businesses owned by him and members of his extended family. [*] 
No longer powerful at home, Mr. Aliyev turned to Washington, knowing that his former father-in-law cared 
greatly about his reputation there. 
Early in 2008 he hired RJI Government Strategies, a small Washington lobbying group whos 
e consultants 
included Tanya Rahall, sister of Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a West Virginia Democrat; and a friend of 
Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California. Both congressmen were booked on a trip to Kazakhstan 
to discuss energy policy with Mr. Nazarbayev. 
Before their departure, members of___________________________to urge him to express strong concerns about the 
harm done to a relative of Mr. Aliyev named Devincci Hourani, whose oil-company assets in Kazakhstan 
were seized, according to a letter to Mr. Issa from RJI. 
Mr. Issa, who had developed a rapport with the Kazakh president on an earlier visit, nonetheless agreed to 
take up the plight of Mr. Hourani. Though he stepped into the fight, he still maintained a close connection to 
the president, nominating him that summer for the Nobel Prize, a move that drew ridicule from human rights 
activists. [that's right, of Vista, CA] [*] 
Ms. Rahall worked on behalf of Mr. Aliyev and later for Mr. Hourani through 2010, contacting the offices of 
at least two dozen members of Congress. They included Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of 
California, then chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, whose office said he discussed the dispute 
with the State Department. 
Ms. Rahall also pursued a second strategy. "The alternative is to embarrass the existing regime," she wrote in 
a July 2008 e-mail to her boss. 
She pressed House members to criticize the Kazakh government's human rights record. At her request, at 
least five statements were published in the Congressional Record, one citing Mr. Aliyev as a victim of his 
government. Separately, Mr. Aliyev offered to provide the Justice Department with documents that he 
claimed could prove that his former father-in-law accepted bribes from a businessman representing American 
oil companies that were seeking drilling rights in Kazakhstan

Lawyers for Imam Wanted by Turkish 
Authorities Fear for Their Client's Life 
Fethullah Gulen has been accused by Turkish President Erdogan of 
ordering the launch of July coup 
DEVLIN BARRETT 
Aug. 5,2016 1:34 p.m. ET 
Lawyers for the imam living in Pennsylvania whom Turkish authorities accuse of directing a coup last month in 
that country said Friday they fear for his life and may ask U.S. authorities to help protect him. 
Since the failed coup that led to the deaths of 271 people, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused 
the imam, Fethullah Gulen, of issuing instructions to launch the coup, a charge Mr. Gulen has denied. 
Turkish authorities have demanded the U.S. extradite Mr. Gulen immediately to Turkey, but The Wall Street 
Journal reported Thursday that U.S. officials don't expect to do that, citing people familiar with the discussions. 
U.S. officials see problems with the evidence presented thus far by Turkey, and they are concerned 
about strident public statements made by Turkish leaders against Mr. Gulen, those people said. 
Mr. Erdogan has called Mr. Gulen and his supporters a terrorist network, a charge U.S. officials have long 
discounted. Turkey in May officially designated Mr. Gulen's network a terrorist organization, making 
membership a crime under Turkish law. 
Mr. Erdogan's government has pressed the Obama administration since the coup to extradite Mr. Gulen, 
arguing that pursuing the imam is part of the broader campaign against terrorism. At times, the Turkish leader's 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031472 
aides have said Ankara would view as hostile any foreign government that gave sanctuary to leaders of the 
Gulen movement. 
Turkey hasn't yet made a formal extradition request to the U.S., and Turkish officials say they plan to provide 
more evidence to the Justice Department. 
Mr. Gulen, 75 years old, came to the U.S. in 1999, and has a devoted following in Turkey and other countries. 
At a press conference in Washington on Friday, Mr. Gulen's lawyers said they have spoken to the Justice 
Department about the demands for extradition but are unaware of the U.S. government's thinking or plans. 
Asked if they feared for his life, one of Mr. Gulen's lawyers, Reid Weingarten said, "We do. We're very 
concerned about his safety." The lawyer said they are discussing whether to ask U.S. authorities for help in 
safeguarding their client. 
A Turkish court has issued a warrant for Mr. Gulen's arrest, and Turkish and U.S. authorities have privately 
discussed scenarios in which Mr. Gulen might be extradited. But several U.S. officials said they cannot now 
envision a scenario in which they turn him over to Turkey. 
"It would be unprecedented and appalling if the U.S. took a frail, almost octogenarian, plopped him on a plane 
to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him by the entire Turkish 
government," said Mr. Weingarten. 
"The bluster, the conspiracy theories, and the threats of Mr. Erdogan are not strong enough to overwhelm the 
American legal system," he added. "And for that reason we believe that Mr. Gulen should not and will not be 
extradited." 
Mr. Weingarten said the chances that his client helped plot a coup from his base in the Poconos is "about as 
likely" as a meteor striking the lawyer's office while he was speaking.

Turkey coup bid: Fethullah Gulen's lawyers 
fear attack on his life 
• 25 minutes ago 
Lawyers for US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen say they fear an attack on his life, in the wake of the failed coup 
attempt on 15 July in Turkey. 
Turkey has issued an arrest warrant for Mr Gulen, accusing him of orchestrating the coup attempt. It has called on the US to 
extradite him. 
Mr Gulen denies any involvement. 
Turkey has cracked down heavily in the wake of the coup attempt. On Friday the governing AK Party ordered an internal purge 
of Gulen supporters. 
More than 270 people died in events surrounding the coup attempt. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031474 
Speaking at a news conference in Washington, Mr Gulen's lawyers said they expected him to remain at the Pennsylvania 
compound where he lives in self-imposed exile, and not attempt to flee. 
Mr Gulen is a reclusive figure who rarely makes contact with the media. 
Although Turkey has demanded his extradition, it has yet to make a formal request. 
The US has said its judiciary will consider a request if and when it is filed. It also asked for evidence of the cleric's involvement 
in the coup attempt, which Turkey says it has supplied. 
Mr Gulen's lawyers said it was most unlikely any extradition request would stand up in a US court and almost no chance that 
their client would get a fair trial in Turkey, given what had been said against him there since the coup attempt. 
One of the lawyers, Reid Weingarten, said: "It would be unprecedented and appalling if the United States took a frail almost-
octogenarian, plopped him on a plane to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him 
by the entire Turkish government." 
Much of Turkey's crackdown has targeted perceived supporters of the cleric. 
Tens of thousands of public sector workers have been suspended or dismissed, with many having their passports cancelled. 
There has also been a massive reshuffle of the military. 
About 18,000 people have been detained or arrested. 
Now local branches of the AK Party have been told to begin a purge of suspected Gulenists in their ranks. 
Mr Gulen had been a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan until a bitter split between his movement and the party of 
the president three years ago. 
Turkey has listed Mr Gulen's movement as a terrorist organisation.

Lawyers for U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen said on 
Friday they feared attacks on his life following Turkey's 
demands that he be extradited to face allegations that he 
ordered a failed coup against the government last month. 
The lawyers said they expected Gulen, who has denied any 
involvement in the July 15 coup attempt, will remain in his 
remote mountain compound in Pennsylvania. 
"We have read concerns from Turkey that Mr. Gulen, this 
elderly, frail religious leader, is going to flee to another country," 
said Steptoe & Johnson LLP attorney Reid Weingarten on 
Friday, calling such allegations "absurd." 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has blamed Gulen for the 
violence, in which Erdogan said 237 people were killed 
excluding the plotters and more than 2,100 wounded, and said 
the United States should extradite him to Turkey. The U.S. 
government has not done so, and the dispute has raised 
questions about relations between the two allies. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031476 
Turkey, a member of the NATO alliance, hosts American troops 
and warplanes at Incirlik Air Base, an important staging area for 
the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. 
At a news conference in Washington, Weingarten and Michael 
Miller, another Steptoe attorney, said evidence from a 2015 
case financed by the Turkish government against Gulen in U.S. 
federal court in Pennsylvania showed that the Turkish 
government relies on dubious proof to make its case against 
him. 
That case alleged Gulen issued coded orders to followers in the 
Turkish judiciary in a 2009 sermon to persecute members of 
another religious sect. It also alleged that the script of a popular 
Turkish television show was laced with follow-up messages. 
The case was dismissed by a judge in June. 
Turkish government officials, however, say such evidence is 
valid because Gulen operates covertly and sends encoded 
messages to his followers. 
Turkey has sent the United States new documents in recent 
days containing evidence that Turkish authorities say proves the 
cleric was behind the attempted coup. U.S. officials say they are 
looking through them.

Will, if you're concerned that people might want to slice it up, then we likely should not go with the FTP site 
(option A), because the link would not be protected and someone could find it. Posting on Steptoe's YouTube 
channel (option B) with secured settings would make the link only accessible to those who receive the link. It 
would also provide reporters with a faster way to view the video since they would not have to download 
it. Does that make sense?

All, 
I just received a copy of the audio recording with Q&A. The video recording will be available mid-to-late 
afternoon. As the file will be too large to distribute via email, we have two posting options: 
; 
a) Upload to Steptoe's FTP site, where the file is public but not (easily) discoverable to the casual Steptoe.com 
browser or searcher. We would send reporters the link, at which point they would download the recording in 
order to watch it. 
B) Upload the file to Steptoe's YouTube channel and set the security around the video so that it's only 
watchable by someone who has the link. It would not be discoverable by anyone who doesn't have the exact 
URL (searching or browsing). The advantage with this option is the reporters could watch the video via the 
YouTube player, rather than downloading a file. 
I believe our preference is the second choice?

Lawyers for Imam Wanted by Turkish 
Authorities Fear for Their Client's Life 
Fethullah Gulen has been accused by Turkish President Erdogan of 
ordering the launch of July coup 
DEVLIN BARRETT 
Aug. 5, 2016 1:34 p.m. ET 
Lawyers for the imam living in Pennsylvania whom Turkish authorities accuse of directing a coup last month in 
that country said Friday they fear for his life and may ask U.S. authorities to help protect him. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031480 
Since the failed coup that led to the deaths of 271 people, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused 
the imam, Fethullah Gulen, of issuing instructions to launch the coup, a charge Mr. Gulen has denied. 
Turkish authorities have demanded the U.S. extradite Mr. Gulen immediately to Turkey, but The Wall Street 
Journal reported Thursday that U.S. officials don't expect to do that, citing people familiar with the discussions. 
U.S. officials see problems with the evidence presented thus far by Turkey, and they are concerned 
about strident public statements made by Turkish leaders against Mr. Gulen, those people said. 
Mr. Erdogan has called Mr. Gulen and his supporters a terrorist network, a charge U.S. officials have long 
discounted. Turkey in May officially designated Mr. Gulen's network a terrorist organization, making 
membership a crime under Turkish law. 
Mr. Erdogan's government has pressed the Obama administration since the coup to extradite Mr. Gulen, 
arguing that pursuing the imam is part of the broader campaign against terrorism. At times, the Turkish leader's 
aides have said Ankara would view as hostile any foreign government that gave sanctuary to leaders of the 
Gulen movement. 
Turkey hasn't yet made a formal extradition request to the U.S., and Turkish officials say they plan to provide 
more evidence to the Justice Department. 
Mr. Gulen, 75 years old, came to the U.S. in 1999, and has a devoted following in Turkey and other countries. 
At a press conference in Washington on Friday, Mr. Gulen's lawyers said they have spoken to the Justice 
Department about the demands for extradition but are unaware of the U.S. government's thinking or plans. 
Asked if they feared for his life, one of Mr. Gulen's lawyers, Reid Weingarten said, "We do. We're very 
concerned about his safety." The lawyer said they are discussing whether to ask U.S. authorities for help in 
safeguarding their client. 
A Turkish court has issued a warrant for Mr. Gulen's arrest, and Turkish and U.S. authorities have privately 
discussed scenarios in which Mr. Gulen might be extradited. But several U.S. officials said they cannot now 
envision a scenario in which they turn him over to Turkey. 
"It would be unprecedented and appalling if the U.S. took a frail, almost octogenarian, plopped him on a plane 
to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him by the entire Turkish 
government," said Mr. Weingarten. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031481 
"The bluster, the conspiracy theories, and the threats of Mr. Erdogan are not strong enough to overwhelm the 
American legal system," he added. "And for that reason we believe that Mr. Gulen should not and will not be 
extradited." 
Mr. Weingarten said the chances that his client helped plot a coup from his base in the Poconos is "about as 
likely" as a meteor striking the lawyer's office while he was speaking.

Turkey coup bid: Fethullah Gulen's lawyers 
fear attack on his life 
• 25 minutes ago 
Lawyers for US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen say they fear an attack on his life, in the wake of the failed coup 
attempt on 15 July in Turkey. 
Turkey has issued an arrest warrant for Mr Gulen, accusing him of orchestrating the coup attempt. It has called on the US to 
extradite him. 
Mr Gulen denies any involvement. 
Turkey has cracked down heavily in the wake of the coup attempt. On Friday the governing AK Party ordered an internal purge 
of Gulen supporters. 
More than 270 people died in events surrounding the coup attempt. 
Speaking at a news conference in Washington, Mr Gulen's lawyers said they expected him to remain at the Pennsylvania 
compound where he lives in self-imposed exile, and not attempt to flee. 
Mr Gulen is a reclusive figure who rarely makes contact with the media. 
Although Turkey has demanded his extradition, it has yet to make a formal request. 
The US has said its judiciary will consider a request if and when it is filed. It also asked for evidence of the cleric's involvement 
in the coup attempt, which Turkey says it has supplied. 
Mr Gulen's lawyers said it was most unlikely any extradition request would stand up in a US court and almost no chance that 
their client would get a fair trial in Turkey, given what had been said against him there since the coup attempt. 
One of the lawyers, Reid Weingarten, said: "It would be unprecedented and appalling if the United States took a frail almost-
octogenarian, plopped him on a plane to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him 
by the entire Turkish government." 
Much of Turkey's crackdown has targeted perceived supporters of the cleric. 
Tens of thousands of public sector workers have been suspended or dismissed, with many having their passports cancelled. 
There has also been a massive reshuffle of the military. 
About 18,000 people have been detained or arrested. 
Now local branches of the AK Party have been told to begin a purge of suspected Gulenists in their ranks. 
Mr Gulen had been a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan until a bitter split between his movement and the party of 
the president three years ago. 
Turkey has listed Mr Gulen's movement as a terrorist organisation.

A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East's most prominent banks did not commit fraud and 
steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership 
collapsed. 
Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment 
system because it didn't want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan's technology to launch its own service. 
The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan's technology. It argued that it cancelled the 
partnership because InfoSpan couldn't produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an 
established company, not one with little to no track record. 
After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and theft 
of trade secrets. 
InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the 
possibility of an appeal. 
The verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile attorneys 
on both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama. 
At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a 
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back 
home through text messages. 
Bajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the business 
and technology. 
To launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled 
by the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund. 
It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine 
company that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s 
The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-made 
market for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply than 
Western Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system. 
A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal's 
fifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees. 
But the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009. 
A few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they 
defrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology. 
Two years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was working 
and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to launch its 
own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan's technology. 
In court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it abhorred 
how much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026005 
"They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money," attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing 
arguments Wednesday. 
Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator David 
Boies — argued that the bank resorted to "pure extortion" in an attempt to get its way. 
As a result of the bank's criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa's partner, Larry Scudder, was detained at 
the Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours until 
he secured his release by turning over his passport. 
According to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told Scudder's passport would be released 
and he could leave the country only if InfoSpan gave up ownership and control of SpanCash to the bank. 
Six months later, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and Scudder got his passport back, but SpanCash's 
reputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The Times. 
The bank disputed that it acquired InfoSpan's source code or used it at any time. 
Former White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never would 
have acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such 
technology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership. 
In her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and InfoSpan 
sold the bank a "bill of goods," arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never worked and 
InfoSpan wasn't as big a company as it claimed. 
The bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the 
bank's money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan's employees, Ruemmler told 
the jury. 
"They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded," she said. 
Lubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that "Emirates 
Bank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts." 
Bajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn't know his next steps. 
"I am just beat up," he said.

So What Does Pizzagate Have To Do With President Bill Clinton? 
President Clinton's involvement in Pizzagate has been peripheral until now, but the scandal is opening closets 
that both Bill and Hillary Clinton would have wished stayed closed. However, last month, the Guardian 
reported that during the second presidential debate, Donald Trump brought along four women who have 
accused Bill Clinton of sex crimes, including rape. 
The U.K. broadsheet surmised that this was an attempt by Trump to deflect from allegations of misogyny and 
sexual misconduct by Trump himself As time has passed, the specter of billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein 
has re-emerged. It is perhaps Clinton's relationship with Epstein that has the greatest bearing on Pizzagate.

Rich Beckler, 
Ken Adams, 
Do you remember when I'd asked you what your daughters did for a living? Especially last night Mr. 
Beckler, as most Friday nights, no? 
Yes, they are the new iterations of Ghislaine Maxwell; for you Richard Beckler, this originated from 
my being a former Stone Ridge classmate of his elder daughter Katie Beckler, and because he was 
on the Board of Stone Ridge during this period in time when my every family, friend, acquaintance 
and association was being contacted, bribed in one form or another, and turned against me (see 
below); as for Ken Adams, it stemmed from my having contacted him for representation in my 2011-
filed case against IBM also during this period of time when my every communication were being 
tracked. 
You both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom, 
Ghislaine Maxwell's Jeffrey Epstein in context.) 
We start from this following precept: (the repeating 9/11s) 
1. "Toward a New World Order" speech by Pres. George H.W. Bush — 9/11 (1990) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 015002 
2. WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001) 
3. BENGHAZI Attack — 9/11 (2012) 
But you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted: 
AUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even 
notice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday 
Night Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October 
31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it. 
That was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his 
popularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on the 
same night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man 
called George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to 
authorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-
determined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like 
Raymond [inaudible] that I mentioned. 
They said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the 
industrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it 
used to be, and that's why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we 
think of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet 
Union because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which 
was not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could 
say that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more 
downhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm 
trying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre... 
Just the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing 
that happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by 
[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite 
famous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was 
the first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real 
heart of what I consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of 
Government which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless 
detention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the 
'80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the 
government, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning. 
And why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the 
government - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on 
September the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do 
on that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event 
in American history but it's not usually told that way. 
We implemented - it's in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that day. 
This is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take 
charge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and 
CENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia. 
This used to be illegal... We had the posse comitatus acts which said, yes, if there's a real emergency 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 015003 
you could call up the ARMY to deal with the emergency, but you cannot do it on a permanent basis 
but we now do do it on a permanent basis. We haven't even bothered to repeal the posse comitatus. 
We are in a state of emergency that was declared on September the 14th, 2001. And it's still 
enforced. It has to be renewed every year. Obama did it every year just as George Bush renewed it 
every year. 
What are the roots of this? Well there are the legitimate roots that go back to fear of an atomic 
decapitation of the government back in the Truman era, so legitimate COG planning goes back to 
Truman and Eisenhower, but the illegitimate use of COG to deal with any emergnecy you like, that 
goes to the Reagan administration and it really goes back to the [Halloween] Massacre where 
Rumsfeld and Cheney put their thumbprint on American politics for the first time. 
-- interview of Peter Dale Scott, @ min. 32:00, 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNqDAYWYFuQ&t=2433s 
This all suggests that the start of the 9/11 agenda pre-dated him as well. I see now that there was a 
seemingly relevant 1990 event as well. "On September 11, 1970 -- a date that only took on haunting 
overtones with the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 -- Nixon became the first U.S. 
president to try to protect air travelers from extremists who sensed gaping vulnerabilities in security 
for commercial airliners, issuing a statement listing a string of measures including the introduction of 
100 air marshals on U.S. planes. "Most countries, including the United States, found effective means 
of dealing with piracy on the high seas a century and a half ago," Nixon said. "We can -- and we will --
deal effectively with piracy in the skies today." 
The President had been jolted into action by the simultaneous hijackings of planes in Europe headed 
to the United States. Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the 
Israeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board. 
The Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted 
to a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the 
hostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let 
Palestinian prisoners go." (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-1970s-richard-
nixon/index.html) 
This 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course. But fast forward and the two secret service 
individuals chosen for an April 2001 interview by a PWC staff member on behalf of what becomthe 
IBM Center for the Business of Government were (1) Steve Colo who happened to be the head of the 
division at SAIC that falsely labeled me a threat and added my name to some sort of Do Not Admit list 
at the end of a 5 month temp assignment in 2005 into early 2006. The consequence of the SAIC 
designation for me was the following: 
(I write) "The SAIC designation took advantage of a devilish stratagem in which as a national security 
employee (having filed out a SF-86 form, governed actually by the GSA - 
https://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/116390 - for government clearance) working a designated 
contract in a classified facility, being designated a disturbance/dissident/threat to operations, makes 
one, in turn, a threat to national security - with all the surveillance/targeting that enables." In essence I 
was made an enemy of the State and was tracked, my family and friends turned, my opportunities 
seized to include the opportunity to rear family as demonstrated especially in the 2007 sabotage of 
my third trimester pregnancy and then the targeting and eventual capture of children I used to babysit 
- in 2011, they were predominantly tweens - to be used for sexual blackmail and other forms of 
leverage. The reason for the use of children in this barbaric way was to expend "ops" that were 
already in effect and had been used to control many of the politicians that have been allowed to rise 
to the top (see info on the Franklin Scandal for example), and similarly according to the laws of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 015004 
compromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly coordinated murder "ops": 
(I write) "The progress that was made from the absorbing of my (small) network (and this through 
sources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to 
participate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading 
only to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you 
see below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf and 
what advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics; and 
one also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's to 
come for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly suspicious 
as noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) "As a former homicide commander, I am 
stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia," William 0. Ritchie, former head of criminal 
investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also raised questions 
about the marshals' actions: "How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post mortem, that he was 
not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did the US Marshal check 
for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation? Did the 
US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning? My gut tells me 
there is something fishy going on in Texas." 
As for SAIC, the following also pertains: 
(I write) "If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase), 
and also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and 
Ben Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture: 
(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered 
into joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011 
Hillary Clinton State Department award (http://www.prnewswire.com/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-
a. .); 
(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon 
thereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion 
dollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...); 
(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as 
corrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... ("[SAIC and 
Tetra Tech's] joint venture, Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (USD, has been awarded a 
contract to provide worldwide civilian police and criminal justice assistance to the U.S. Department of 
State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)... [specifically} to provide 
INL with program management, criminal justice, and life and mission support to countries emerging 
from conflict or otherwise facing instability challenges. Under this new contract, IJSI will provide 
technical assistance, training, logistics and infrastructure services to support the Department of 
State's efforts to strengthen criminal justice systems in select partner countries.")... yet, just months 
shy of contract end, the NY Times reported: "Tasked With Combating Opium, Afghan Officials Profit 
From It:" "Penetrating Every Stage of Afghan Opium Chain, Taliban become a Cartel:" and "Corrupt 
Combatants Fight for Control of Lucrative Afghan Drug Trade:" see also here an overview of the 
growth of Afghan opium production from the start of the US occupation (2001) to the present, and 
especially from contract start (2011) to end (2016): http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-spoils-of-war-
afghanist.../91; 
(4) and that the award Bud Horton helped secure just as Sue's contract was coming to an end was 
not only born from what looks like Franklin Scandal compromises, but it is this contract that seems 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 015005 
intent on implementing bioterrorism as the new form of explosive terrorism." 
(Note that both members of this family were awarded BILLION dollar contracts; that's quite 
exceptional, no?) 
As for terrorism as an US industry, it's hardly better seen than through the following which is 
information of course we all know: 
We note that in-between Bush #41's 9/11/1990 speech(with Dick Cheney as his Secretary of 
Defense) and the 9/11/2001 attack on the WTC were little more than Clinton's 8 years in the White 
House. We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between 
the actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack 
on the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no 
uncertain terms sponsored terrorism: 
(Writes Scott) "The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult 
and painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection we 
have surveyed: 
1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to 
participate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; 
2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which could 
have prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; 
3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him 
free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing; 
4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an "unindicted coconspirator" in the 1993 WTC bombing case 
and Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing. 
(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State) 
Scott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack on 
the WTC: 
(Writes Scott) "For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened, 
letting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by some 
as "conspiracy theory." Yet in this chapter, I will show that this claim doesn't to arise from theory, but 
from facts that are true, even though they have been systemically suppressed or under-reported in 
the American mainstream media. I am describing a phenomenon that occurred not just once, but 
repeatedly, almost predictably. We shall see that, among the al-Qaeda terrorists who were first 
protected and then continued their activities were the following: 
1. Ali Mohamed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the leader of the 1998 Nairobi Embassy 
bombing; 
2. Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier 
of both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle 
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; 
3. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as "the principal architect of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 015006 
the 9/11 attacks"; 
4. Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers, whose presence in the 
United States was concealed from the FBI by CIA officers for months before 9/11. 
It might sound from these citations that the 9/11 Commission marked a new stage in the U.S. 
treatment of these terrorists, and that the report now exposed those terrorists who in the past had 
been protected. On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that 
1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection 
(the "al-Qaeda connection," if you will); 
2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection; 
3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one 
commission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness 
(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists' protectors. 
In the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], I came to another disturbing conclusion I had 
not anticipated. This is that a central feature of the protection has been to defend the 9/11 
Commission's false picture of al-Qaeda as an example of non-state terrorism, ignoring not just the 
CIA but also the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In reality, as I shall show, royal family 
protection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given to 
key figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged "principal architect of the 9/11 attacks." The 
establishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global 
"war on terror." But this "war on terror" has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and 
Pakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United 
States has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these 
Sunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves 
overthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or 
sanctioned and threatened as part of an "axis of evil" (in the case of Iran). We should not forget that, 
just one day after 9/11, "Rumsfeld was talking about broadening the objectives of our response and 
'getting Iraq." 
(pp. 44-45, The American Deep State) 
Clinton's daughter is now poised to work global health initiatives which I would suggest is little more 
than a cover for on-going terrorism "ops". 
To return to Steve Colo - in the interview he speaks of a partnership between the Secret Service, the 
FBI, and South Carolina's SLED (State Law Enforcement Division) to open a Computer Crime Center. 
Bud Horton (mentioned above) (long-affiliated with IT Security; his title at Accenture was Chief 
technology officer of it's cyber security practice) happened to have just moved to South Carolina from 
Loudoun County after being implicated in a continuing child sex scandal (see details below). Further, 
cyber-crime just so happens to be another of the arenas in which our Intelligence Community 
coordinates with the Russians: "The US cooperates with the FSB and Russia's interior ministry on 
counter-terrorism, organized crime, bio-terrorism, and cyber-crime." -- p. 243, Expelled: A Journalist's 
Descent into the Russian Mafia State, by Luke Harding) Most would interpret this quote to suggest 
that the nations work together to prevent these various threats. The reality is more the opposite; trust 
me when I say that the US doesn't work "ops" alone - the 2005 London Bombings is one notable 
example of a instance in which the US coordinated with also British intelligence in the perpetration of 
an attack.) I just tweeted this morning actually the following in regards to US coordinations with the 
Russians: "One must know a renowned Rus mafiaso was granted entry

I'm forwarding the below information as it pertains to Mrs. Lesley Simms and more importantly the 
ones with whom she continues to coordinate. 
As you may know, she was once close with an individual named Matthew Horton with whom she 
attended George Mason University, and through Matthew, Ms. Simms became well-acquainted with 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 015008 
Matthew's parents Henry "Bud" Horton and Sue Popovich Horton who helped secure her a position at 
IBM upon her graduation from GMU. Both of these latter individuals (Bud and Sue Horton) were 
involved in the 2007 murder of my son, and they in collusion with their son Matthew continue in the 
exploitation of children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. The powers that be intend now for these children to 
(continue to) follow in the footsteps of Ms. Simms, and to that end, I would advise that you become 
acquainted with (1) the ways in which Ms. Simms subsidized her law school education and off course 
(2) her current and related endeavors especially as they relate to drug trafficking and terror financing 
(see below email to Mr. Martin of the St. Augustine Record).

Mr. Martin, 
St. Augustine Record 
Quite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see: 
Deputy Banks' attorney claims FDLE agent's credibility 'destroyed') It must also be explored, of 
course, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a terrorist 
financing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) "Agent Rodgers 
joined the state's elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where he 
quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping dismantle 
a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East" - and that terrorism is very 
much a well-protected U.S. industry (see below). 
God forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as 
you yourself report, "As written in [Plaintiff Banks] motion: "Defendant Rodgers' false, misleading and 
inconsistent testimony throughout the discovery process is so pervasive and extreme, and involves 
so many material issues, it has destroyed Defendant's credibility on all issues..." And here we see the 
"whole-of-government" attempts to restore balance. 
As for the second Secret Service agent interviewed by the IBM Center for the Business of 
Government, his name is Dana Brown. He just so happened to have filled out his career with the 
Federal Air Marshall Service (October 2003-August 2008 as Director/Chief of Staff) followed by the 
TSA (March 2006-January 2009 as Asst. Administrator-Law Enforcement/Integrity Officer) states his 
Linked In profile. That he worked his way around to that which was largely put in place by the 1970 
9/11 mini-event seems to me rather significant although I don't see all the details yet. I also don't yet 
see exactly who it was that birthed this lengthy 9/11 initiative we're suffering. It seems clear, however, 
that it was birthed prior to 1970. 
The initiative has adjusted in some ways over time, but homage to 9/11 remains strong. Certain of the 
people deeply involved in these manipulations thought it was kismet that an individual well-suited to 
head the newly ordained Department of Homeland Security (that as we all know was the result of 
legislation rushed through Congress in the aftermath of the 9/11 (2001) attack) was born on the 
magical September 11th (this is Jeh Johnson); similarly, it is again being deemed a sign that the new 
Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (chosen and positioned as she was) is first-named 
France (last name Cordova) and that this name so perfectly relates to US intentions to use the NSF 
to forward "ops" that will solidify a US-France working relationship in the same way the 2005 London 
Bombings helped solidify the US-British working relationship. These France going-ons are in higher 
gear (I've noticed) since Macron was elected but it was prepped for long ago. I was working for IBM 
under IBM project manager Cathie Skoog at the NSF when my third trimester pregnancy was 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 015009 
sabotaged. The story of this sabotage and what followed is (briefly) this: 
I've long-alleged that John and Avery Gunther (whose children I used to babysit) agreed to a quid pro 
quo exchange of financial compensation for help destroying my credibility on behalf of IBM against 
whom I'd filed a 2010 EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) charge and a subsequent 
May 2011 civil suit. 
Per the May 11, 2011 Complaint, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther: 
3. On April 6, 2011 Mr. and Mrs Gunther, with uncontrolled greed and total disregard for the rights 
and feelings of Ms. Nadine McGuire as well as those of their children, AFG and XWG, maliciously 
and with ill-intent, wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary 
Injunction requesting formal protection against Ms. Nadine McGuire. 
4. Over the course of the previous few months, Mr. and Mrs. Gunther, colluding with persons against 
whom Ms. Nadine McGuire is currently furthering litigation, including but not limited to plaintiff's 
mother, Pauline Scala McGuire, and from whom they received and/or have been promised to receive 
monetary incentives, hid their relationships with said individuals, further lied about having those 
relationships in direct conversation with Ms. Nadine McGuire and Court testimony on May 4, 2011, 
and wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction against 
Ms. Nadine McGuire in cooperation and collaboration with said persons, resulting in the issuance of a 
Temporary Restraining Order against Ms. Nadine McGuire issued on April 6, 2011. 
- Initial Complaint, 5/11/11, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther, Case No.:2011 CA 003703 B, DC 
Superior Court, Judge Gregory Jackson presiding 
In regards to the suit against IBM (McGuire v. IBM, 1:11CV528, US District Court of Virginia), the only 
suit in which Pauline Scala McGuire was listed as a defendant, the most important claim was one of 
"assault" that led to the 2007 death of my son. Per the filing: 
Plaintiff, Grace Nadine McGuire, realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1-65 hereof as if fully set 
forth within and further alleges: 
66. Defendant Palmisano's conduct in ascertaining the drug that was used on the plaintiff to end her 
pregnancy and take the life of her child on April 22, 2007, constitutes an intentional touching of the 
plaintiff by defendant Palmisano, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the 
plaintiff and her unborn child. 
67. Defendant Skoog, Susan Horton and Scala's conduct in coordinating the circumstances, creating 
physical proximity and the administering of the drug to the plaintiff that ended her pregnancy and took 
the life of her child on April 22, 2007 constituted an intentional touching of the plaintiff by said 
defendants, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the plaintiff and her 
unborn child. 
... 69. As the direct and proximate result of defendant Palmisano, Skoog, Susan Horton, and Scala's 
conduct, the plaintiff suffered a severe placental abruption, which terminated her pregnancy and 
ended the life of her unborn child, causing the plaintiff to suffer damages including but not limited to 
the loss of her child, loss of affection, grief, sorrow, extreme mental torment and emotional distress.

This is to say that John and Avery Gunther helped IBM defend against an allegation of murder, and in 
this way they are accomplices to a cover-up. This is also to say that the characterization provided by 
John and Avery Gunther in their April 2011 Superior Court filing for a Protection Order against me 
and their admissions in this filing of having provided derogatory information to various persons and/or 
entities in the DC area to include school administrators, psychologists, and law enforcement, were 
more to harm me, especially in my chances to hold IBM accountable, than to protect either 
themselves or children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. 
I also long-allege that the relationship that developed from this initial quid pro quo led to John and 
Avery Gunther being similarly compensated for what turned into the sexual exploitation of their two 
daughters. For more on child sexual exploitation for the sake of personal and professional leverage, 
see especially the following: 
Nick Bryant I The Franklin Scandal & The Elite's Pedophilia Cover Up, 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68gyGGPjmOo&t=978s 
That the NSF won't acknowledge the abuse, and won't respond even to my FOIA requests, and 
otherwise has gone to extents to protect Cathie Skoog and her co-conspirators at IBM and otherwise 
is all that was needed to have adequately turned the organization towards the interests of the Deep 
State. Now it is simply a matter of the Deep State continuing to put the NSF to use.

Jeffrey Epstein in context: 
(As sent to the Wash Post) 
I send you this in response to the recent column entitled Believe in the Process by Kenneth Starr. 
Perhaps rethink any public affiliation with Ken Starr; although his demeanor on paper is undoubtably 
consoling, it is also a bit intoxifying when it would be best now if we keep our wits about us, no? 
I say this from the following perspective - Ken Starr of the Starr Report, attorney for (1) Erik Prince of 
Blackwater and (2) convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in context: 
The Starr Report buried behind salacious detail of the Lewinsky affair almost nothing of Whitewater, 
Travelgate, or otherwise what many consider the murder of Vince Foster (Foster, albeit the subject of 
a different investigation was also under the purview of attorney Starr and formal investigation of the 
results of Starr's investigation were drowned out by the details of the Lewinsky affair.) This is a bit 
strange considering the Lewinsky affair was a moral failing and not an actionable criminal one as 
would have been the others had any proof surfaced. 
Starr later defended Blackwater against wrongful deaths suit initiated by the families of the 2004 
Fallujah Ambush victims - "In October 2006, Blackwater hired one of the nation's heaviest-hitting 
lawyers to represent it - Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the 1999 impeachment of 
President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal... Starr and his colleagues argued that 
Blackwater was "constitutionally immune" from such lawsuits and said that if the Fallujah case were 
allowed to proceed, "Blackwater will suffer irreparable harm." In the eighteen-page petition to the 
Supreme Court, Blackwater argued that there are no other such lawsuits against private 
military/security companies in state courts "because the comprehensive regulatory scheme enacted 
by Congress and the President grant military contractors like Blackwater immunity from state-court 
litigation." (pp. 234-235, Blackwater). (Author Ken Davis writes) "The four men had spent the night 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 015011 
before they set off at marine base Camp Fallujah. But the men kept their distance from the 
leathernecks. Had they spoken to the marines, the Blackwater team might have learned that the 
Americans were already in the midst of a major offensive meant to assert control over the 
increasingly restive city, where elements of the radical Islamist movement and remnants of Saddam's 
army were beginning to aggressively strike back. at the American occupation" (p. 306, The Hidden 
History of American at War), and perhaps this is the only thing that makes sense of the fact that 
"Under the terms of its contract, Blackwater was supposed to supply these convoy security missions 
with two SUVs, each carrying three guards per vehicle; a driver, one man riding shotgun, and a third 
man in back with a heavy machine gun. Instead, the foursome set out that morning with just two men 
per car, each vehicle missing their rear gunner. The SUVs were only outfitted with a steel plate as 
extra armor. And the men had not been given maps." (p. 305). 
Starr went on to defend Jeffrey Epstein abasing allegations of child sex trafficking - "Along with a 
dream team of attorneys that included Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Ken Starr, [Alan Dershowitz] 
was successful in getting federal investigators not to charge Epstein with moving his victims across 
state lines and other associated crimes. The federal non-prosecution agreement Epstein's legal team 
negotiated with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida immunized all named and 
unnamed "potential co-conspirators" in Epstein's child trafficking network, which includes those who 
allegedly procured minors for Epstein and also any powerbrokers who may have molested them" (-
http://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-ped...). Otherwise, Epstein's eventual 18 
month sentence by the state of Florida was exceptionally light under the circumstances to include the 
number of victims who came forward with testimony. This is best understood in the context of children 
being used as a means to government-sponsored sexual blackmail and other forms of leverage. 
See here Erik Prince in greater context: (the similarities between him and once (secretly) favored 
child Bin Laden) 
The coordinations among global intelligence to make rather than eliminate terror as seen thru 
"assets" bin Laden (as M. Noriega before him) & Erik Prince:

[Saudi intell and warlords like Sayyaf." 
(www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=ahmed_badeeb_1) 
About EP: "Handcuffed by politics, the CIA had not been able to cultivate relationships with the key 
but messy leaders. Fortunately, Blackwater had no such political restrictions." (p. 54, Civilian Warriors 
by E. Prince) 
We see also: 
About BL: "Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained 
volunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic 
Republic of Afghanistan" (Wikipedia) 
About EP: "In his autobiography, he states that during the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s, he 
realized the need for private training facilities for special operations... Prince moved to Virginia Beach 
and personally financed the formation of Blackwater Worldwide in 1997. He bought 6,000 acres (24 
km2) of the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina and set up a school for special operations" 
(Wikipedia) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 015012 
Erik Prince is (becoming) no less an Amer. intelligence success story than bin Laden (in support of 
Terrorism as Geostrategy & a New World Order - see below). In short: (we note the repeating 9/11s, 
every 11 years): "Toward a NWO" speech by Bush #41 - Sept. 11 ('90); The WTC - Sept. 11 ('01); 
Benghazi - Sept. 11 ('12). (There is rhy. & reason also 2 the rise of ISIS.) 
*** 
About training camps: 
I watched so to speak the creating of little torture pockets around the world as justified by Obama's 
desire to close Gitmo. The White House reports (2/23/16): "We'll continue to securely and responsibly 
transfer to other countries the 35 detainees already approved for transfer. This process involves 
extensive and careful coordination across our federal government to ensure that our national security 
interests are met when an individual is transferred to another country. We insist, for example, that 
foreign countries institute strong security measures." But are these not just the seeds of new training 
camps (growing concentrated and lauded violent temperaments) & was that not someone's exact 
intent? 
In real-time (and as perpetrated on captured children): 
3/19/14, sent to the now defunct FB page of D. Cheney: 
Dick Cheney, 
I wonder if it's possible that there is coordination with other countries concerning enhanced 
interrogation techniques, in the form of training perhaps? 
Specifically, here in the United States, my sense is that there may be the use of vulnerable 
populations, with the intension to gain favor with and/or intimidate others, especially members of the 
international community.

You both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom, 
Ghislaine Maxwell's Jeffrey Epstein in context.) 
We start from this following precept: (the repeating 9/11s) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017590 
1. "Toward a New World Order" speech by Pres. George H.W. Bush — 9/11 (1990) 
2. WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001) 
3. BENGHAZI Attack — 9/11 (2012) 
But you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted: 
AUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even 
notice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday 
Night Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October 
31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it. 
That was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his 
popularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on 
the same night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man 
called George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to 
authorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-
determined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like 
Raymond [inaudible] that I mentioned. 
They said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the 
industrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it 
used to be, and that's why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we 
think of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet 
Union because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which 
was not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could 
say that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more 
downhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm 
trying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre... 
Just the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing 
that happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by 
[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite 
famous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was 
the first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real 
heart of what I consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of 
Government which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless 
detention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the 
'80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the 
government, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning. 
And why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the 
government - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on 
September the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do 
on that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event 
in American history but it's not usually told that way. 
We implemented - it's in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that 
day. This is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take 
charge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and 
CENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017591 
This used to be illegal... We had the posse comitatus acts which said, yes, if there's a real 
emergency you could call up the ARMY to deal with the emergency, but you cannot do it on a 
permanent basis but we now do do it on a permanent basis. We haven't even bothered to repeal the 
posse comitatus. We are in a state of emergency that was declared on September the 14th, 2001. 
And it's still enforced. It has to be renewed every year. Obama did it every year just as George Bush 
renewed it every year. 
What are the roots of this? Well there are the legitimate roots that go back to fear of an atomic 
decapitation of the government back in the Truman era, so legitimate COG planning goes back to 
Truman and Eisenhower, but the illegitimate use of COG to deal with any emergnecy you like, that 
goes to the Reagan administration and it really goes back to the [Halloween] Massacre where 
Rumsfeld and Cheney put their thumbprint on American politics for the first time.

This all suggests that the start of the 9/11 agenda pre-dated him as well. I see now that there was a 
seemingly relevant 1990 event as well. "On September 11, 1970 -- a date that only took on haunting 
overtones with the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 -- Nixon became the first U.S. 
president to try to protect air travelers from extremists who sensed gaping vulnerabilities in security 
for commercial airliners, issuing a statement listing a string of measures including the introduction of 
100 air marshals on U.S. planes. "Most countries, including the United States, found effective means 
of dealing with piracy on the high seas a century and a half ago," Nixon said. "We can -- and we will - 
- deal effectively with piracy in the skies today." 
The President had been jolted into action by the simultaneous hijackings of planes in Europe headed 
to the United States. Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the 
Israeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board. 
The Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted 
to a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the 
hostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let 
Palestinian prisoners go." (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-1970s-richard-
nixon/index.html) 
This 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course. But fast forward and the two secret service 
individuals chosen for an April 2001 interview by a PWC staff member on behalf of what becomthe 
IBM Center for the Business of Government were (1) Steve Colo who happened to be the head of 
the division at SAIC that falsely labeled me a threat and added my name to some sort of Do Not 
Admit list at the end of a 5 month temp assignment in 2005 into early 2006. The consequence of the 
SAIC designation for me was the following: 
(I write) "The SAIC designation took advantage of a devilish stratagem in which as a national 
security employee (having filed out a SF-86 form, governed actually by the GSA - 
https://www.osa.clov/portal/forms/download/116390 - for government clearance) working a 
designated contract in a classified facility, being designated a disturbance/dissident/threat to 
operations, makes one, in turn, a threat to national security - with all the surveillance/targeting that 
enables." In essence I was made an enemy of the State and was tracked, my family and friends 
turned, my opportunities seized to include the opportunity to rear family as demonstrated especially 
in the 2007 sabotage of my third trimester pregnancy and then the targeting and eventual capture of 
children I used to babysit - in 2011, they were predominantly tweens - to be used for sexual 
blackmail and other forms of leverage. The reason for the use of children in this barbaric way was to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017592 
expend "ops" that were already in effect and had been used to control many of the politicians that 
have been allowed to rise to the top (see info on the Franklin Scandal for example), and similarly 
according to the laws of compromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly 
coordinated murder "ops": 
(I write) "The progress that was made from the absorbing of my (small) network (and this through 
sources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to 
participate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading 
only to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you 
see below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf 
and what advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics; 
and one also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's 
to come for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly 
suspicious as noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) "As a former homicide 
commander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia," William 0. Ritchie, former 
head of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also 
raised questions about the marshals' actions: "How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post 
mortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did 
the US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have 
suggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest 
poisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas." 
As for SAIC, the following also pertains: 
(I write) "If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase), 
and also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and 
Ben Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture: 
(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered 
into joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011 
Hillary Clinton State Department award (http://www.prnewswire.com/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-
a...); 
(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon 
thereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion 
dollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...); 
(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as 
corrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... ("[SAIC and 
Tetra Tech's] joint venture, Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (USD, has been awarded a 
contract to provide worldwide civilian police and criminal justice assistance to the U.S. Department of 
State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)... [specifically} to 
provide INL with program management, criminal justice, and life and mission support to countries 
emerging from conflict or otherwise facing instability challenges. Under this new contract, IJSI will 
provide technical assistance, training, logistics and infrastructure services to support the Department 
of State's efforts to strengthen criminal justice systems in select partner countries.")... yet, just 
months shy of contract end, the NY Times reported: "Tasked With Combating Opium, Afghan 
Officials Profit From It:" "Penetrating Every Stage of Afghan Opium Chain, Taliban become a Cartel:" 
and "Corrupt Combatants Fight for Control of Lucrative Afghan Drug Trade:" see also here an 
overview of the growth of Afghan opium production from the start of the US occupation (2001) to the

(4) and that the award Bud Horton helped secure just as Sue's contract was coming to an end was 
not only born from what looks like Franklin Scandal compromises, but it is this contract that seems 
intent on implementing bioterrorism as the new form of explosive terrorism." 
(Note that both members of this family were awarded BILLION dollar contracts; that's quite 
exceptional, no?) 
As for terrorism as an US industry, it's hardly better seen than through the following which is 
information of course we all know: 
We note that in-between Bush #41's 9/11/1990 speech(with Dick Cheney as his Secretary of 
Defense) and the 9/11/2001 attack on the WTC were little more than Clinton's 8 years in the White 
House. We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between 
the actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack 
on the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no 
uncertain terms sponsored terrorism: 
(Writes Scott) "The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult 
and painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection 
we have surveyed: 
1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to 
participate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; 
2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which 
could have prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; 
3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him 
free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing; 
4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an "unindicted coconspirator" in the 1993 WTC bombing case 
and Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing. 
(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State) 
Scott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack 
on the WTC: 
(Writes Scott) "For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened, 
letting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by 
some as "conspiracy theory." Yet in this chapter, I will show that this claim doesn't to arise from 
theory, but from facts that are true, even though they have been systemically suppressed or under-
reported in the American mainstream media. I am describing a phenomenon that occurred not just 
once, but repeatedly, almost predictably. We shall see that, among the al-Qaeda terrorists who were 
first protected and then continued their activities were the following: 
1. Ali Mohamed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the leader of the 1998 Nairobi 
Embassy bombing; 
2. Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier 
of both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017594 
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; 
3. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as "the principal architect of 
the 9/11 attacks"; 
4. Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers, whose presence in the 
United States was concealed from the FBI by CIA officers for months before 9/11. 
It might sound from these citations that the 9/11 Commission marked a new stage in the U.S. 
treatment of these terrorists, and that the report now exposed those terrorists who in the past had 
been protected. On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that 
1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection 
(the "al-Qaeda connection," if you will); 
2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection; 
3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one 
commission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness 
(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists' protectors. 
In the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], I came to another disturbing conclusion I had 
not anticipated. This is that a central feature of the protection has been to defend the 9/11 
Commission's false picture of al-Qaeda as an example of non-state terrorism, ignoring not just the 
CIA but also the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In reality, as I shall show, royal family 
protection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given 
to key figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged "principal architect of the 9/11 attacks." The 
establishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global 
"war on terror." But this "war on terror" has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and 
Pakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United 
States has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these 
Sunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves 
overthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or 
sanctioned and threatened as part of an "axis of evil" (in the case of Iran). We should not forget that, 
just one day after 9/11, "Rumsfeld was talking about broadening the objectives of our response and 
'getting Iraq." 
(pp. 44-45, The American Deep State) 
Clinton's daughter is now poised to work global health initiatives which I would suggest is little more 
than a cover for on-going terrorism "ops". 
To return to Steve Colo - in the interview he speaks of a partnership between the Secret Service, the 
FBI, and South Carolina's SLED (State Law Enforcement Division) to open a Computer Crime 
Center. Bud Horton (mentioned above) (long-affiliated with IT Security; his title at Accenture was 
Chief technology officer of it's cyber security practice) happened to have just moved to South 
Carolina from Loudoun County after being implicated in a continuing child sex scandal (see details 
below). Further, cyber-crime just so happens to be another of the arenas in which our Intelligence 
Community coordinates with the Russians: "The US cooperates with the FSB and Russia's interior 
ministry on counter-terrorism, organized crime, bio-terrorism, and cyber-crime." -- p. 243, Expelled: A 
Journalist's Descent into the Russian Mafia State, by Luke Harding) Most would interpret this quote 
to suggest that the nations work together to prevent these various threats. The reality is more the 
opposite; trust me when I say that the US doesn't work "ops" alone - the 2005 London Bombings is 
one notable example of a instance in which the US coordinated with also British intelligence in the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017595 
perpetration of an attack.) I just tweeted this morning actually the following in regards to US 
coordinations with the Russians: "One must know a renowned Rus mafiaso was granted entry 
https://en.wikipedia.orcilwiki/Vyacheslay Ivankov#Movinq to the United States ... be4 the real

security issue, not a diversion".

Matthew's parents Henry "Bud" Horton and Sue Popovich Horton who helped secure her a position 
at IBM upon her graduation from GMU. Both of these latter individuals (Bud and Sue Horton) were 
involved in the 2007 murder of my son, and they in collusion with their son Matthew continue in the 
exploitation of children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. The powers that be intend now for these children

Quite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see: 
Deputy Banks' attorney claims FDLE agent's credibility 'destroyed') It must also be explored, of 
course, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a 
terrorist financing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) "Agent 
Rodgers joined the state's elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where 
he quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping 
dismantle a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East" - and that 
terrorism is very much a well-protected U.S. industry (see below). 
God forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as 
you yourself report, "As written in [Plaintiff Banks] motion: "Defendant Rodgers' false, misleading 
and inconsistent testimony throughout the discovery process is so pervasive and extreme, and 
involves so many material issues, it has destroyed Defendant's credibility on all issues..." And here 
we see the "whole-of-government" attempts to restore balance. 
As for the second Secret Service agent interviewed by the IBM Center for the Business of 
Government, his name is Dana Brown. He just so happened to have filled out his career with the 
Federal Air Marshall Service (October 2003-August 2008 as Director/Chief of Staff) followed by the 
TSA (March 2006-January 2009 as Asst. Administrator-Law Enforcement/Integrity Officer) states his 
Linked In profile. That he worked his way around to that which was largely put in place by the 1970 
9/11 mini-event seems to me rather significant although I don't see all the details yet. I also don't yet 
see exactly who it was that birthed this lengthy 9/11 initiative we're suffering. It seems clear, 
however, that it was birthed prior to 1970. 
The initiative has adjusted in some ways over time, but homage to 9/11 remains strong. Certain of 
the people deeply involved in these manipulations thought it was kismet that an individual well-suited 
to head the newly ordained Department of Homeland Security (that as we all know was the result of 
legislation rushed through Congress in the aftermath of the 9/11 (2001) attack) was born on the 
magical September 11th (this is Jeh Johnson); similarly, it is again being deemed a sign that the new 
Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (chosen and positioned as she was) is first-
named France (last name Cordova) and that this name so perfectly relates to US intentions to use 
the NSF to forward "ops" that will solidify a US-France working relationship in the same way the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017597 
2005 London Bombings helped solidify the US-British working relationship. These France going-ons 
are in higher gear (I've noticed) since Macron was elected but it was prepped for long ago. I was 
working for IBM under IBM project manager Cathie Skoog at the NSF when my third trimester 
pregnancy was sabotaged. The story of this sabotage and what followed is (briefly) this: 
I've long-alleged that John and Avery Gunther (whose children I used to babysit) agreed to a quid 
pro quo exchange of financial compensation for help destroying my credibility on behalf of IBM 
against whom I'd filed a 2010 EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) charge and a 
subsequent May 2011 civil suit. 
Per the May 11, 2011 Complaint, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther: 
3. On April 6, 2011 Mr. and Mrs Gunther, with uncontrolled greed and total disregard for the rights 
and feelings of Ms. Nadine McGuire as well as those of their children, AFG and XWG, maliciously 
and with ill-intent, wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary 
Injunction requesting formal protection against Ms. Nadine McGuire. 
4. Over the course of the previous few months, Mr. and Mrs. Gunther, colluding with persons against 
whom Ms. Nadine McGuire is currently furthering litigation, including but not limited to plaintiff's 
mother, Pauline Scala McGuire, and from whom they received and/or have been promised to receive 
monetary incentives, hid their relationships with said individuals, further lied about having those 
relationships in direct conversation with Ms. Nadine McGuire and Court testimony on May 4, 2011, 
and wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction against 
Ms. Nadine McGuire in cooperation and collaboration with said persons, resulting in the issuance of 
a Temporary Restraining Order against Ms. Nadine McGuire issued on April 6, 2011. 
- Initial Complaint, 5/11/11, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther, Case No.:2011 CA 003703 B, DC 
Superior Court, Judge Gregory Jackson presiding 
In regards to the suit against IBM (McGuire v. IBM, 1:11CV528, US District Court of Virginia), the 
only suit in which Pauline Scala McGuire was listed as a defendant, the most important claim was 
one of "assault" that led to the 2007 death of my son. Per the filing: 
Plaintiff, Grace Nadine McGuire, realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1-65 hereof as if fully set 
forth within and further alleges: 
66. Defendant Palmisano's conduct in ascertaining the drug that was used on the plaintiff to end her 
pregnancy and take the life of her child on April 22, 2007, constitutes an intentional touching of the 
plaintiff by defendant Palmisano, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards 
the plaintiff and her unborn child. 
67. Defendant Skoog, Susan Horton and Scala's conduct in coordinating the circumstances, creating 
physical proximity and the administering of the drug to the plaintiff that ended her pregnancy and 
took the life of her child on April 22, 2007 constituted an intentional touching of the plaintiff by said 
defendants, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the plaintiff and her 
unborn child. 
... 69. As the direct and proximate result of defendant Palmisano, Skoog, Susan Horton, and Scala's 
conduct, the plaintiff suffered a severe placental abruption, which terminated her pregnancy and 
ended the life of her unborn child, causing the plaintiff to suffer damages including but not limited to 
the loss of her child, loss of affection, grief, sorrow, extreme mental torment and emotional distress.

Virginia - Eastern Division, Alexandria, Judge Leonie Brinkema presiding 
This is to say that John and Avery Gunther helped IBM defend against an allegation of murder, and 
in this way they are accomplices to a cover-up. This is also to say that the characterization provided 
by John and Avery Gunther in their April 2011 Superior Court filing for a Protection Order against me 
and their admissions in this filing of having provided derogatory information to various persons 
and/or entities in the DC area to include school administrators, psychologists, and law enforcement, 
were more to harm me, especially in my chances to hold IBM accountable, than to protect either 
themselves or children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. 
I also long-allege that the relationship that developed from this initial quid pro quo led to John and 
Avery Gunther being similarly compensated for what turned into the sexual exploitation of their two 
daughters. For more on child sexual exploitation for the sake of personal and professional leverage, 
see especially the following:

That the NSF won't acknowledge the abuse, and won't respond even to my FOIA requests, and 
otherwise has gone to extents to protect Cathie Skoog and her co-conspirators at IBM and otherwise 
is all that was needed to have adequately turned the organization towards the interests of the Deep 
State. Now it is simply a matter of the Deep State continuing to put the NSF to use.

Jeffrey Epstein in context: 
(As sent to the Wash Post) 
I send you this in response to the recent column entitled Believe in the Process by Kenneth Starr. 
Perhaps rethink any public affiliation with Ken Starr; although his demeanor on paper is undoubtably 
consoling, it is also a bit intoxifying when it would be best now if we keep our wits about us, no? 
I say this from the following perspective - Ken Starr of the Starr Report, attorney for (1) Erik Prince of 
Blackwater and (2) convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in context: 
The Starr Report buried behind salacious detail of the Lewinsky affair almost nothing of Whitewater, 
Travelgate, or otherwise what many consider the murder of Vince Foster (Foster, albeit the subject 
of a different investigation was also under the purview of attorney Starr and formal investigation of 
the results of Starr's investigation were drowned out by the details of the Lewinsky affair.) This is a 
bit strange considering the Lewinsky affair was a moral failing and not an actionable criminal one as 
would have been the others had any proof surfaced. 
Starr later defended Blackwater against wrongful deaths suit initiated by the families of the 2004 
Fallujah Ambush victims - "In October 2006, Blackwater hired one of the nation's heaviest-hitting 
lawyers to represent it - Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the 1999 impeachment of 
President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal... Starr and his colleagues argued that 
Blackwater was "constitutionally immune" from such lawsuits and said that if the Fallujah case were 
allowed to proceed, "Blackwater will suffer irreparable harm." In the eighteen-page petition to the 
Supreme Court, Blackwater argued that there are no other such lawsuits against private 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017599 
military/security companies in state courts "because the comprehensive regulatory scheme enacted 
by Congress and the President grant military contractors like Blackwater immunity from state-court 
litigation." (pp. 234-235, Blackwater). (Author Ken Davis writes) "The four men had spent the night 
before they set off at marine base Camp Fallujah. But the men kept their distance from the 
leathernecks. Had they spoken to the marines, the Blackwater team might have learned that the 
Americans were already in the midst of a major offensive meant to assert control over the 
increasingly restive city, where elements of the radical Islamist movement and remnants of 
Saddam's army were beginning to aggressively strike back. at the American occupation" (p. 306, 
The Hidden History of American at War), and perhaps this is the only thing that makes sense of the 
fact that "Under the terms of its contract, Blackwater was supposed to supply these convoy security 
missions with two SUVs, each carrying three guards per vehicle; a driver, one man riding shotgun, 
and a third man in back with a heavy machine gun. Instead, the foursome set out that morning with 
just two men per car, each vehicle missing their rear gunner. The SUVs were only outfitted with a 
steel plate as extra armor. And the men had not been given maps." (p. 305). 
Starr went on to defend Jeffrey Epstein abasing allegations of child sex trafficking - "Along with a 
dream team of attorneys that included Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Ken Starr, [Alan Dershowitz] 
was successful in getting federal investigators not to charge Epstein with moving his victims across 
state lines and other associated crimes. The federal non-prosecution agreement Epstein's legal 
team negotiated with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida immunized all named and 
unnamed "potential co-conspirators" in Epstein's child trafficking network, which includes those who 
allegedly procured minors for Epstein and also any powerbrokers who may have molested them" (-
http://dawker.com/flioht-loos-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-ped...). Otherwise, Epstein's eventual 18 
month sentence by the state of Florida was exceptionally light under the circumstances to include 
the number of victims who came forward with testimony. This is best understood in the context of 
children being used as a means to government-sponsored sexual blackmail and other forms of 
leverage.

child Bin Laden)

Erik Prince is (becoming) no less an Amer. intelligence success story than bin Laden (in support of 
Terrorism as Geostrategy & a New World Order - see below). In short: (we note the repeating 9/11s, 
every 11 years): "Toward a NWO" speech by Bush #41 - Sept. 11 ('90); The WTC - Sept. 11 ('01); 
Benghazi - Sept. 11 ('12). (There is rhy. & reason also 2 the rise of ISIS.)

About training camps: 
I watched so to speak the creating of little torture pockets around the world as justified by Obama's 
desire to close Gitmo. The White House reports (2/23/16): "We'll continue to securely and 
responsibly transfer to other countries the 35 detainees already approved for transfer. This process 
involves extensive and careful coordination across our federal government to ensure that our 
national security interests are met when an individual is transferred to another country. We insist, for 
example, that foreign countries institute strong security measures." But are these not just the seeds 
of new training camps (growing concentrated and lauded violent temperaments) & was that not 
someone's exact intent? 
In real-time (and as perpetrated on captured children): 
3/19/14, sent to the now defunct FB page of D. Cheney: 
Dick Cheney, 
I wonder if it's possible that there is coordination with other countries concerning enhanced 
interrogation techniques, in the form of training perhaps? 
Specifically, here in the United States, my sense is that there may be the use of vulnerable 
populations, with the intension to gain favor with and/or intimidate others, especially members of the 
international community.

[These were continuing experimentations in reversed-engineered SERE; the agreed upon

(during the Bush administration), and afterwards. See here for example: "And I think, you know,

the people who were, you know, doing these interrogations, because the logic, which I think Mark 
had mentioned, is, you know, this circular logic. So long as there are trained psychologists from 
the SERE program who are on site at these interrogations who are saying that these detainees can 
withstand this treatment, are not being harmed psychologically, then it's not torture. So, you know, 
you've got this sort of [inaudible] tortured — tortured logic, which is the phrase that has come up, but 
it's this sort of self-justifying loop in which professionals are loaning their credentials to this kind of

lawyers loaning their credentials to approving what are clear violations of the Geneva Conventions."

GOP fundraiser Broidy under investigation 
for alleged effort to sell government 
influence, people familiar with probe say 
Carol D. Leonnig 
The Justice Department is investigating whether longtime Republican fundraiser Elliott 
Broidy sought to sell his influence with the Trump administration by offering to deliver U.S. 
government actions for foreign officials in exchange for tens of millions of dollars, 
according to three people familiar with the probe. 
As part of the investigation, prosecutors are scrutinizing a plan that Broidy allegedly 
developed to try to persuade the Trump government to extradite a Chinese dissident back to 
his home country, a move sought by Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to two of the 
people. 
They are also investigating claims that Broidy sought $75 million from a Malaysian business 
official if the Justice Department ended its investigation of a development fund run by the 
Malaysian government. The Malaysian probe has examined the role of the former prime 
minister in the embezzlement of billions of dollars from the fund. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031764 
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Christopher Clark, an attorney 
for Broidy, declined to comment. 
Broidy's alleged activities were detailed in news reports earlier this year that cited hacked 
emails. The Los Angeles-based venture capitalist, who served as top fundraiser for the 
Republican Party and President Trump, has said  that allegations against him are an effort by 
his enemies to smear him. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, said he had no knowledge of any request for 
records related to Broidy. The White House referred a request for comment to the 
Republican National Committee, which declined to comment. 
[Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy sues Qatar alleging cyber smear campaign] 
In recent weeks, prosecutors with the Justice Department's public integrity section___which 
examines possible political and government corruption___have sought documents related to 
Broidy's business dealings. 
Among the information sought by investigators are details about Broidy's work on behalf of 
and interactions with the Chinese and Malaysian officials, according to two people familiar 
with the document requests. 
As part of their efforts, prosecutors have subpoenaed casino magnate Steve Wynn, the 
former RNC finance chairman and longtime Trump friend, for copies of records and 
communications related to Broidy. 
An attorney for Wynn, Reid Weingarten, declined to comment, saying only that Wynn is 
cooperating with the Justice Department. 
"Steve Wynn is completely cooperating with the investigation and he certainly has no reason 
to believe that anyone acted improperly in anything he knew about or was involved in," 
Weingarten said in a statement. 
Wynn was tapped by Trump to serve as the RNC 's lead fundraiser after the election. Earlier 
this year, he stepped down from that post and from his executive role at his resort company 
after reports of sexual misconduct. Wynn has denied the allegations of inappropriate 
behavior. 
The public integrity probe is the latest legal challenge for Broidy, who helped corral big  
donors to support Trump's presidential campaign, throwing a lavish fundraiser for the then-
nominee at his Los Angeles-area home during the 2016 campaign. After the election, he was 
appointed to serve as a national deputy chairman for the RNC. 
Broidy sought to parlay his party role and connections to the White House and on Capitol 
Hill in pitches to foreign governments, according to a person with direct knowledge of his 
activities.

In April, he resigned from his RNC position in the wake of a report that he had paid a former 
Playboy model $1.6 million in exchange for her silence about a sexual affair. Trump's 
personal attorney, Michael Cohen___another RNC fundraiser___helped arrange the 
settlement, Broidy acknowledged. 
[RNC deputy finance chair steps down after admitting Trump's lawyer negotiated settlement 
between him and pregnant Playboy model] 
Cohen is under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan who are examining 
whether he fraudulently obtained millions of dollars in loans and whether his efforts to 
squash negative stories about Trump during the campaign violated election law. 
Broidy's business dealings captured the attention of investigators for special counsel Robert 
S. Mueller III, who asked at least one witness about Broidy's activities, according to a 
person familiar with the matter. 
Broidy's attempts to solve high-level headaches for the Chinese and Malaysian governments 
were first reported this spring by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, which 
cited in part a cache of hacked emails. 
Broidy has said the documents were stolen by enemies seeking to ruin his reputation. 
"This whole narrative is a fabrication driven by hackers who want to undermine me," Broidy 
said in a statement to the Times. Earlier this year, he filed a lawsuit against the country of 
Qatar, alleging that it hacked his email accounts in retaliation for his allegations that Qatar 
supports terrorists. A spokesman for the Qatari government has called the suit "without fact 
or merit. 
,1 
The Journal reported in March that, according to a draft contract, Broidy and his wife, Robin 
Rosenzweig, were seeking $75 million from Malaysian businessman Jho Low if federal 
prosecutors dropped their investigation into a Malaysian state investment fund. 
The Justice Department has filed civil suits claiming $4.5 billion in public money was 
misappropriated from the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, seeking to claim a portion 
of those assets. Last month, Malaysian authorities charged former prime minister Najib 
Razak with embezzling billions in public money from the fund. 
Clark, the Broidy attorney, told The Journal that Rosenzweig's firm had been hired to 
provide strategic advice to Low, adding that "at no time did Mr. Broidy or Ms. Rosenzweig, 
or anyone acting on their behalf, discuss Mr. Low's case with President Trump, any member 
of his staff, or anyone at the U.S. Department of Justice." 
The Times reported  in April that Broidy had explored ways to force Chinese exile Guo 
Wengui to leave the United States. The billionaire businessman had fled China in 2014 as he 
was facing arrest for a range of charges, including corruption. Guo has said the allegations 
were fabricated by a government that wants to silence him. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031766 
Since his arrival in the U.S., Guo has publicly detailed allegations of corruption in the 
Chinese ruling party. 
The Times reported that Broidy drafted a plan to enlist Emirati officials to pressure the U.S. 
to turn over Guo. In his statement to the newspaper, Broidy said he "never had a strategy or 
plan regarding Mr. Guo nor was there any compensation given or even discussed." 
Broidy's alleged efforts to push for Guo's extradition came after Wynn separately helped 
deliver a message from the Xi government seeking to have the dissident returned to China, 
according to a person familiar with the effort. 
Wynn, who has contacts with Chinese officials because of his business interests in Macau, 
hand-delivered a letter to Trump seeking Guo '5 deportation, The Journal reported  last year. 
A spokesman for Wynn Resorts has said that the report about Wynn's role was false. 
At the time, the president expressed interest in assisting the Chinese, but was met with 
resistance by senior law enforcement officials, according to the person. 
White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.

Miami U.S. Attorney's Office recuses itself from Jeffrey Epstein case 
Play Video 
DurationA 3:51 
AG nominee Barr pledges to look into handling of Epstein case 
Sen. Ben Sasse questioned attorney general nominee William Barr about the Jeffrey Epstein case on January 15, 
2019, getting the nominee to commit to having the Department of Justice look into the handling of that case if 
confirmed. C-SPAN Meta Viers 
BY JULIE K. BROWN

R REPRINT OF THIS STORY 
Just days before a Friday deadline, the Justice Department has reassigned the Jeffrey Epstein victims' rights 
case to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta, the attorneys representing Epstein's victims' attorneys said 
Tuesday. 
Miami federal prosecutors, in letter to attorneys for the victims's lawyers on Monday, said they had recused 
themselves from the case, according to Brad Edwards and Jack Scarola, representing Epstein's victims. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031388 
The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, Byung J. "BJay" Pak, will 
oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta's chief federal 
prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017. 
The Justice Department is still under a Friday deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims' attorneys in 
an effort to settle the case. On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra in Palm Beach ruled that federal 
prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke the law when they concealed a plea 
agreement from more than 30 underage girls in Palm Beach who had been sexually abused by Epstein, a 
multimillionaire New York hedge fund manager. 
Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted Epstein and an untold number of accomplices 
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided Epstein plead guilty to minor charges in 
state court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against Epstein to 
write a 53-page federal indictment, court records show.

An investigation by the Miami Herald, "Perversion of Justice," found that after Acosta met privately with one 
of Epstein's lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not 
even the state court judge who sentenced Epstein — would know the full extent of his crimes. Epstein, now 66, 
was allowed to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where 
he was given liberal work release, and allowed to travel to New York and his private island in the Caribbean 
during his subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between New York, 
Palm Beach and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
The Herald interviewed four of Epstein's victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by 
Epstein. They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead 
of victims. Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which 
grants crime victims the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors. 
Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, but 
they misled the girls into believing that the FBI's sex trafficking case against Epstein was ongoing — when, in 
fact, prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record. 
Marra, noting that he reviewed affidavits, depositions and interrogatories, said "Epstein worked in concert with 
others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031389 
The victims' attorneys — Edwards, Scarola and Paul Cassell — have asked the Justice Department to throw out 
Epstein's plea agreement and reopen the criminal investigation. 
Edwards, who brought the victims' rights case against the government, said transferring the case to another 
jurisdiction is a prudent decision. 
"I think it's good that we're going to get fresh eyes and a fresh opinion on the way the case was handled," 
Edwards said Tuesday. "We were obviously in an adversarial posture with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami 
because they handled the case to begin with." 
Miami's new U.S. Attorney, Ariana Fajardo Orshan — who was appointed by President Trump in September 
— did not respond to a request for comment.

Edwards predicted that it would take some time for Pak's office to review the case, which includes more than 
500 docket entries and thousands of documents. He said If the sides can't agree on a resolution, then Marra 
would likely have to come up with one. The case is being closely watched by crime victims' rights advocates, 
as it will likely set a precedent. 
Acosta, who was appointed by Trump as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017, is the focus of a separate Justice 
Department investigation into whether there was any prosecutorial misconduct in the Epstein case. That probe, 
by the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility, was initiated in response to demands from a bipartisan 
group in Congress, led by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz of Florida. 
In the meantime, a court hearing will be held at 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York in another Epstein-related case. 
A federal appeals court will hear oral arguments in a motion by the Miami Herald, supported by 32 other news 
organizations, asking the court to unseal documents that could reveal details about the extent of Epstein's 
crimes and any other people who may have been involved. 
Three of Epstein's former attorneys — who helped negotiate his plea deal in 2008 — wrote a letter published in 
the New York Times on Monday, defending the plea bargain cut with Acosta as a fair deal. The letter was in 
response to a Times editorial that called on Congress and the Trump administration to hold Acosta and others 
involved in the case accountable.

Epstein's lawyers said the editorial's conclusions were "in profound conflict with the reality," noting that there 
was no evidence that Epstein committed federal sex trafficking offenses. The letter was signed by former 
Epstein lawyers Kenneth Starr, Jack Goldberger and Lilly Ann Sanchez, as well as Epstein's current attorney, 
Martin G. Weinberg.
