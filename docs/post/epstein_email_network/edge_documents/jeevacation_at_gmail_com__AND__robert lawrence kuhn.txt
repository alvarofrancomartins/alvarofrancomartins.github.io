You are a prophet.. 
was just with senior leaders in Beijing.. 
I'll be discussing China-U.S. relations under "President Trump" with the former Chinese Ambassador to the 
U.S on CCTV News ("Closer To china"), broadcast in china and internationally (NY - "CCTV News" channel) - 
Saturday at 8:30 pm and Sunday at 8:30 am New York time. Not an interview - we will each question each 
other 
we're playing in new territory here. There may be some contributions we can make. To be discussed 
privately. I return to Los Angeles on Nov. 17, but dont get to NY until Dec. 24, after my next trip to 
Beijing.

On point! First serious, independent confirmation of Giulio Tononi's theory. This constitutes the primary part of 
our Episode 6 (working outline). Giulio is a Closer To Truth contributor (primarily his theory of consciousness) 
and a friend; he has invited me/CTT to spend 1-2 days in his lab (Madison).

Pardon the formality below - I want to approach your very legitimate questions / concerns in a serious 
manner. 
Attached and below the same. 
Dear Jeffrey: 
As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV 
series "The Science of Sleep and Dreams": 
(i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional 
understandings) to justify a major TV series? 
(ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for 
corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? 
In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, 
Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at 
length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More 
importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in 
related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the "Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams" (2012) and 
the sole author of the forthcoming "An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams" (Cambridge 
University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for 
graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. 
When we asked Patrick, his first response — "This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story" — and he 
cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well 
corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper 
understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and 
established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and 
pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes 
(e.g., PTSD and Depression). 
To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that 
there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-
movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement 
gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves 
(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is 
Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has 
been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and 
confirmed in very recent years (as explained below). 
Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are 
now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the 
public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams 
essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. 
Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory 
consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. 
Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many 
neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025106 
Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and 
Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. 
This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact 
that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of 
dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with 
rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated" 
(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is 
why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that 
the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and 
dreams can enhance creativity. 
As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: "It would be nice if we could talk about sleep 
and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. 
Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of 
post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed." 
Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. 
Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive 
that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that 
going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various 
non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a 
stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that 
fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This 
gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are "genetic conflict" studies 
with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and 
differences between males and females in which genes get "imprinted". 
Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new 
neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a 
vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in 
the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in 
the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why 
REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). 
Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only 
in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and 
statistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, 
including cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size 
and structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. 
Patterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. 
Males will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers 
are often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness 
by the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) 
"Lucid Dreaming" is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer "knows" that 
he/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be 
trained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering 
their brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). 
Neuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is 
itself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now 
enables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In 
REM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is "down-regulated", whereas the limbic system is "up-regulated", 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025107 
showing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will 
enable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) 
Patrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding 
sleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the "purpose" of sleep and dreams, as well 
as engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). 
Attached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, 
especially 2015-2017). 
You'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want. 
Love to do this series together with you.

Ruminating (in Beijing traffic) on plant biology and ways to structure possible Closer To Truth (CTT) series to 
portray your sense and insights. 
For plant biology per se, there's probably three strong episodes, with higher production values needed to 
illustrate ideas/principles (more than the usual CTT talking heads). To fit the CTT framework (and audience 
expectation), these fascinating discoveries or hints of complex, multifarious mechanisms would need to be 
explored (even if not yet understood) in terms of simple, fundamental principles (applicable across disciplines - 
so-called 'general systems theory'). 
This potential series on plant biology could be extended to 5-6 episodes by including medicinals - plant 
derivatives that are, for some conditions, best treatments for numerous diseases. This could include, for 
example, a critical look at Chinese medicine. 
I think, though, there is a bigger idea lurking here. Your unique ways of thinking, exemplified by plant biology, 
encourages another, larger possibility for a significant CTT series. Each of the topics you've brought up, and 
many of your past fundings, sought kinds of breakthroughs or radically new ways of approaching reality and the 
knowledge and manipulation of reality. So, how about producing a big CTT series on just that - "Radical 
Breakthroughs"? 
I can imagine CTT episodes on each of the following kinds of topics you've mentioned, in which radical 
breakthroughs or deep structural significance are being appreciated: 
- Plant Biology 
- Deception (biology) 
- Power Laws ("found everywhere in nature, Pareto, law of large numbers") 
- New Math ("category theory, membrane computing, as a new tool for cognition") 
- Mathematics and Truth 
- Music ("a tool to interogate the brain, not a product of but a lense into the inner software") 
- Dreams ("always on, consciousness blocking access, schizo have sleep disorders") 
- Power (nature,as you said, "financial, physical, intellectual, ability to do things in a local space") 
I'm sure there are other such categories of 'radical breakthrough' - for example, several wild ideas in 
neuroscience, such as levels of information from sub-cellular to massive circuitry. 
We would clearly unify the topics and episodes with an overarching thematic vision of "radical breakthroughs" 
that "challenge conventional wisdom" (this phrase was an early Closer To Truth subtitle). 
Several of these topics can have more than one episode. We can easily produce 13 high-quality episodes and 
thus have a coherent full season on "Radical Breakthroughs", which would be distributed and marketed as such. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025310 
Such an approach to "Radical Breakthroughs" is core CTT - in fact, I attempted this as part of the very first 
CTT series in 1999/2000 
"How do Breakthroughs Change Science" - with evolutionary biologist Francisco Ayala; philosopher and 
neuroscientist Patricia Smith Churchland; author/astronomer Timothy Ferris; child psychologist Rochel 
Gelman; and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson - https://www.closertotruth.com/roundtables/how-do-
breakthroughs-change-science  
"What are the Big Questions of Science?" - with evolutionary biologist Francisco Ayala; philosopher and 
neuroscientist Patricia Smith Churchland; author/astronomer Timothy Ferris; theoretical physicist Steve 
Koonin; and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson - https://www.closertotruth.com/roundtables/what-are-the-big-
questions-science  
Though the production values of these early shows are much lower than our current version (since 2008), the 
content and contributors suggest how CTT can do a big new series - a full season of 13 episodes - on "Radical 
Breakthroughs". 
Appreciate specific direction, so that when we meet, I can be prepared 
Love to do something big and dramatic together.

Just arrived in Beijing for the "The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation" (commentating), the 
second most important event of 2017 in China (after the upcoming Party Congress), but Western media not 
paying much attention, what with All-Things-Trump.

Agree! 'Get It Right' is singular priority - we think alike. This is the Role and Importance of pre-production. 
Funds adequate. 
Clarity critical, as is charisma. However, given intimacy of TV interviews, it's not always apparent upfront who 
communicates well. Usually by not always. Sometimes someone who is a great lecturer to 500 students falls flat 
or off puts as arrogant. Sometimes a mousey introvert with intense eye and facial expressions sparkles and 
radiates. There is no substitute, however, for clarity. 
Looking forward to discussion.

Initial ideas:

because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner's 
'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)', astrophysics, cosmology, biology, 
general systems theory. I've felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think three 
episodes could work - if you agree, I'll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 parts. 
Also, Closer To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 
episodes!), so this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029127 
series. 
* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un 
of Wisconsin-Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory. 
* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my 
expertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you 
need to tell me if you would like to include this. 
* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability 
in biomedical and especially psychological research - the scandal in recent years. See links and attachments.

Terrific; looking forward. 
Excited to go through math candidates on the list, others too. 
Equally important, discuss edits/modifications to the 13 episodes (cutting blahs), expanding math episodes - see 
below. Assuming we expand math episodes, we will need more mathematicians. 
How's late afternoon after 5:30 pm / early evening today? - or weekend, day/times? (Family issues today - 
mother 102 in May.) 
RADICAL BREAKTHROUGHS - Initial Revisions (working model for discussion, red is new) 
Expand and Modify Mathematical Breakthrough episodes 
1. Mathematics and Truth / Overview / Show Excitement/Importance 
2. Mathematical Fields / Diverse New Kinds and Categories 
3. How Math Works in Disparate Areas of Knowledge (from fundamental physics to chemistry, biology 
[molecular and evolutionary[, psychology, sociology, economics, etc.) 
4. Power Laws 
5. Mathematical Biology 
6. Foundations of Mathematics / Philosophy/Meaning of Math (discovered/invented?) 
ADD/Exchange to Biological Breakthrough episodes 
9/10. Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability in 
biomedical and psychological research - the scandal in recent years. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029150 
In the non-Closer To Truth world.... 
Did CNN Intl this morning on Trump's China-oil-N.Korea-cheating tweet "Caught RED HANDED..." 
[pun deliberate] 
My favorite fun lines (there are so many) in Trump's NYTimes spontaneous interview. 
2) "I like very much President Xi. He treated me better than anybody's ever been treated in the history of 
China." 
Ever (-5,000 year history) 
1) "I know the details of taxes better than anybody___better than the greatest CPA." 
Not, mind you, CPAs in general, not even smart Jewish CPAs who work all the time - but whoever, out

Radical Breakthrough Development Work 
• Research on each of the 13 episodes is ongoing and we are moving towards creating a short list of the top 
contributors per episode (with some contributors in multiple episodes). 
• We are aggregating the top contributors around 4 to 5 central locations, such as SF Bay Area, LA, Chicago, 
Boston, New York, Santa Fe, London, Oxford, and Cambridge for the main shoots. 
• We are creating a short list of locations for the secondary shoot - i.e. the more observational shoots on 
specific labs and research facilities, such as the Music Lab at McGill, the Sleep Lab at Harvard. 
• We are planning a recce in the autumn to assess locations and meet some of the key contributors. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029293 
• We've brought on a production manager / line producer as we develop detailed research, contributors, 
locations, budgets. 
• Our team is working toward interviewing and hiring a top science-literate associate producer / dedicated 
research producer. We've been coordinating with colleagues at HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Association) 
as well as National Geographic for staffing referrals, and now have a strong short list. This is a critical, long-
term position. 
• We are assessing graphics and animation companies and researching styles and graphic ideas that we might 
use to communicate some of the more complex ideas. 
• Our digital team is researching a web extension for the www.closertotruth.com website, developing ideas for 
a dedicated site neighborhood for "Radical Breakthroughs." We are in discussions with several website 
design companies, including the company that designed and built our original CTT site, for ideas and bids on 
creating the expanded site. 
• By mid-October, we expect to begin to schedule the shoots.
