Ribis's Italian immigrant parents taught him to be tightfisted, but it was the Donald who introduced him to 
dealmaking. As a kid in the New Jersey suburbs, Ribis rose before dawn to count the empty soda bottles at the 
family deli "so the suppliers couldn't cheat my mom on the deposits." When Trump faced bankruptcy in 1989, 
he turned to the team of Ribis and Steve Bollenbach, now CEO of Hilton Hotels, to fend off the banks and 
bondholders. Ribis helped persuade creditors to let Trump keep his trophy holding: his casinos. It was the 
gaming company's IPO in 1995, orchestrated by Ribis, that restored Trump's wealth.

German Media Confess to 
Underestimating Steve 
Bannon; He Is 'As Dangerous 
as Ever' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025517 
by THOMAS D. WILLIAMS, PH.D.11 Mar 201.-

As Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-
establishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but 
admit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims. 
In this week's issue, the left-wing German weekly Stern articulates the greatest fear of the European 
establishment: that Bannon "could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric." 
Many thought that the reign of the "Dark Lord" had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left 
first the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that 
Bannon's adversaries had underestimated him, because he is "as dangerous as ever," he confesses. 
Kramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon's ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by "frenetic 
applause" in his recent address before France's National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his 
"impressive potential," which the writer describes as "dangerous." 
In the mind of his audience, Bannon is something of a miracle-worker, Stamper notes, having "done the 
impossible" by bringing Donald Trump into the White House. 
The reason Bannon is dangerous, Kramper continues, is because he "lays out the political program of a 
worldwide right: He has already conquered the USA; now Europe and then the whole world will follow." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025518 
"You are part of a worldwide movement that is bigger than France, bigger than Italy, bigger than Hungary, 
bigger than all that," Bannon told French populists. 
Bannon showed that he "dominates the mood against the 'elites,' the 'establishment' and the 'perverse system' 
of greedy corporations and banks, and of course also against the press, which is led around 'like a dog on the 
Leash," Stamper writes. 
And now he Mr. Bannon setting himself up as an instigator, if not an outright shepherd, of a movement that 
crosses borders, languages and parties. 
"Bannon is a master of apocalyptic rhetoric," Stamper continues, effortlessly weaving together nationalist 
interests with an international populist movement. 
The American strategist showed his "true caliber" by expounding modern methods of political freedom through 
blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, Stamper said, leaving many of his hearers behind. Bannon has 
demonstrated that if the right wants to rule the future, "it must dominate modern themes and rhetorically 
position them," he added. 
Aspiring to be far more than an uncle who tells stories to his nephews of how he won the fight for the White 
House, Stamper writes, "Bannon wants to become the super godfather of the international right." 
Although Bannon often looks a bit disheveled, "he should not be underestimated," the writer warns. Past 
business partners attribute impressive "strategic foresight" to the eccentric tactician, saying he was often "three 
or four steps ahead" of his opponents in business. Because of his phenomenal memory, his nickname is "the 
encyclopedia," Stamper notes with a certain reverence, and in his speeches he will spontaneously cite "forgotten 
thinkers, known only to a handful of specialists." 
"Bannon brings with him exclusive knowledge of power from the very heart of power," Stamper writes, which 
he will bring to bear on Europe's fragmented populist populism. 
According to Stamper, Bannon has established his "European headquarters" in Italy, from where he intends to 
galvanize European populists. 
The Italian political situation is completely to his liking, Stamper declares, with a political landscape 
"dominated by populists, right-wing ideologues and the political puppeteer Berlusconi."

Unfortunately, bin Sulayem and I did not meet. I was stuck at the White House and he had a narrow window 
before heading to Cyprus. I just sent him the following note: 
"Good Morning, I hope your travels to Cyprus were smooth. 
Okey Enelamah, Nigeria's trade minister, stopped by my home this evening as he was still in town after Buhari's 
visit with Trump. He mentioned his discussions with you at WEF and afterwards. Separately, I spoke earlier 
with the Vice President. 
Whenever we meet, I have some thoughts that may be helpful to you."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Associated Press has learned that investigators working with special counsel Robert Mueller 
have interviewed Tom Barrack, a close friend and confidant of President Donald Trump. 
Three people familiar with the probe tell the AP that Barrack met with federal investigators working on the Russia inquiry. 
The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. 
Barrack's spokeswoman, Lisa Baker, declined to comment. 
Barrack has known Trump for decades. He's been one of Trump's closest advisers through the 2016 campaign and into the 
administration. Barrack also is a leading fundraiser for the president and oversaw the fundraising for the inauguration. 
Barrack has a longstanding relationship with Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort's onetime 
deputy, Rick Gates. 
Gates agreed to begin cooperating with Mueller's investigators in February.

Having shed or sidelined some of the top advisers who held him back in the past, Mr. Trump gives the 
appearance of a leader liberated at last to follow the china-breaking instincts that have long animated his

• • The Department of Justice lost its latest battle with Congress Thursday when it agreed to brief House 
Intelligence Committee members about a top-secret intelligence source that was part of the FBI's 
investigation of the Trump campaign. Even without official confirmation of that source's name, the news so 
far holds some stunning implications. 
Among them is that the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation outright hid critical 
information from a congressional investigation. In a Thursday press conference, Speaker Paul Ryan bluntly 
noted that Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes's request for details on this secret source was "wholly 
appropriate," "completely within the scope" of the committee's long-running FBI investigation, and 
"something that probably should have been answered a while ago." Translation: The department knew full 
well it should have turned this material over to congressional investigators last year, but instead deliberately 
concealed it. 
House investigators nonetheless sniffed out a name, and Mr. Nunes in recent weeks issued a letter and a 
subpoena demanding more details. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's response was to double 
down—accusing the House of "extortion" and delivering a speech in which he claimed that "declining to 
open the FBI's files to review" is a constitutional "duty." Justice asked the White House to back its 
stonewall. And it even began spinning that daddy of all superspook arguments—that revealing any detail 
about this particular asset could result in "loss of human lives." 
This is desperation, and it strongly suggests that whatever is in these files is going to prove very 
uncomfortable to the FBI. 
The bureau already has some explaining to do. Thanks to the Washington Post's unnamed law-enforcement 
leakers, we know Mr. Nunes's request deals with a "top secret intelligence source" of the FBI and CIA, who 
is a U.S. citizen and who was involved in the Russia collusion probe. When government agencies refer to 
sources, they mean people who appear to be average citizens but use their profession or contacts to spy for 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020819 
the agency. Ergo, we might take this to mean that the FBI secretly had a person on the payroll who used his 
or her non-FBI credentials to interact in some capacity with the Trump campaign. 
This would amount to spying, and it is hugely disconcerting. It would also be a major escalation from the 
electronic surveillance we already knew about, which was bad enough. Obama political appointees 
rampantly "unmasked" Trump campaign officials to monitor their conversations, while the FBI played dirty 
with its surveillance warrant against Carter Page, failing to tell the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court 
that its supporting information came from the Hillary Clinton campaign. Now we find it may have also been 
rolling out human intelligence, John Le Carr& style, to infiltrate the Trump campaign. 
Which would lead to another big question for the FBI: When? The bureau has been doggedly sticking with 
its story that a tip in July 2016 about the drunken ramblings of George Papadopoulos launched its 
counterintelligence probe. Still, the players in this affair—the FBI, former Director Jim Comey, the Steele 
dossier authors—have been suspiciously vague on the key moments leading up to that launch date. When 
precisely was the Steele dossier delivered to the FBI? When precisely did the Papadopoulos information 
come in? 
And to the point, when precisely was this human source operating? Because if it was prior to that infamous 
Papadopoulos tip, then the FBI isn't being straight. It would mean the bureau was spying on the Trump 
campaign prior to that moment. And that in turn would mean that the FBI had been spurred to act on the 
basis of something other than a junior campaign aide's loose lips. 
We also know that among the Justice Department's stated reasons for not complying with the Nunes 
subpoena was its worry that to do so might damage international relationships. This suggests the "source" 
may be overseas, have ties to foreign intelligence, or both. That's notable, given the highly suspicious role 
foreigners have played in this escapade. It was an Australian diplomat who reported the Papadopoulos 
conversation. Dossier author Christopher Steele is British, used to work for MI6, and retains ties to that spy 
agency as well as to a network of former spooks. It was a former British diplomat who tipped off Sen. John 
McCain to the dossier. How this "top secret" source fits into this puzzle could matter deeply. 
I believe I know the name of the informant, but my intelligence sources did not provide it to me and refuse to 
confirm it. It would therefore be irresponsible to publish it. But what is clear is that we've barely scratched 
the surface of the FBI's 2016 behavior, and the country will never get the straight story until President 
Trump moves to declassify everything possible. It's time to rip off the Band-Aid.

The FBI briefed House Intelligence Committee members about a top-secret intelligence source but did not

It makes no difference how honorable he is. His investigation is tainted by the bias that

Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may face a serious legal obstacle: It is tainted by 
antecedent political bias. The June 14 report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's 
inspector general, unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking officials at the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. Some of their communications, the report says, were "not only indicative of a 
biased state of mind but imply a willingness to take action to impact a presidential candidate's electoral 
prospects." Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain whether this bias "directly 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026273 
affected" specific FBI actions in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, it nonetheless affects the 
legality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. 
Crossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its FBI progenitors—the same ones who 
had investigated Mrs. Clinton—deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign advisers, 
obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wiretap warrants, issued national security letters to 
gather records, and unmasked the identities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They also 
repeatedly leaked investigative information. 
Mr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn't expected to finish for months. But the 
current report reveals that FBI officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald 
Trump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Trump 
investigations, confidently assuaged a colleague's fear that Mr. Trump would become president: "No 
he won't. We'll stop it." An unnamed FBI lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was 
"devastated" and "numb" after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to another FBI attorney: "Viva le 
resistance." 
The report highlights the FBI's failure to act promptly upon discovering that Anthony Weiner's laptop 
contained thousands of Mrs. Clinton's emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the "higher 
priority" of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz writes: "We did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to 
prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on [the] investigative lead discovered on the 
Weiner laptop was free from bias." 
Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey was trying 
to influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the 
inspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was motivated 
by a desire to protect her assumed presidency's legitimacy. 
The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text messages "created the appearance that investigative 
decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations." The report adds, importantly, that "most 
of the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation." Given how biases 
ineluctably shape behavior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton 
investigation and building a narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials 
sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton's electoral chances and, if the unthinkable happened, obtain an insurance 
policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of illegitimacy. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026274 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May 2017 after President Trump 
fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general concludes that the pervasive bias "cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned," including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was 
politically motivated, then its culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All 
special-counsel activities—investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and 
convictions—are fruit of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due process. That Mr. Mueller 
and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin offers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or property, it is required to use fundamentally 
fair processes. The Supreme Court has made clear that when governmental action "shocks the 
conscience," it violates due process. Such conduct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that 
appear, under the totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entrapment. 
In U.S. v. Russell (1973), the justices observed: "We may someday be presented with a situation in 
which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would 
absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction." It didn't take 
long. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), the court concluded that due process was offended by a 
prosecutor's "realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness' " that tainted the "very initiation of proceedings." 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton (1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have "power to 
employ the full machinery of the state in scrutinizing any given individual. . . we must have assurance 
that those who would wield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibility for 
the attainment of justice." Prosecutors must be "disinterested" and make "dispassionate assessments," 
free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias violated due 
process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earlier, in prosecuting the death-row inmate 
whose habeas corpus petition he was hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not 
vitiate the taint but heighten "the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might 
otherwise be obscured," the justices wrote. A single biased individual "might still have an influence 
that, while not so visible . . . is nevertheless significant." 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the inspector general, there is a strong 
circumstantial case—including personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire 
was initiated for political, not national-security, purposes. 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department presumption against investigating 
campaigns in an election year. And while impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-
Attorney General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is "particularly important in an election 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026275 
year," and "politics must play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investigators regarding 
any investigations. . . . Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of 
investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of 
giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party." 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the case with the bureau's investigation of 
Mrs. Clinton's private email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But 
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence investigation predicated on the 
notion that Russia could be colluding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no 
discernible evidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing 
the notion that it was initiated "for the purpose" of affecting the presidential election. 
The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers. But 
nothing in the public record suggests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative 
therefore hinges on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump's election, and that 
the Trump campaign reciprocated by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance 
and investigation, there's still no public evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to 
sow political discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump. 
Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advocated dovish policies. But so did 
numerous American political and academic elites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential 
campaigns routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign powers. The Clinton campaign 
funded the Steele dossier, whose British author paid Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta 
Group, led by the brother of Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for 
Russia's largest baffl( and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties. The 
Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses. 
No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured 
to London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to 
dinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he'd heard about such dirt but never seen it. These 
circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment. 
The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr. 
Papadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between 
the DNC hack and the Trump campaign. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026276 
Crossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs. 
Clinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If 
anything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by 
dangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it. 
Given the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence 
investigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and 
subsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates 
were Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he 
could protect his campaign and the country. 
Mr. Trump's critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not 
leaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the 
Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire's launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr. 
Comey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons embarked 
on a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington. 
On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader 
Harry Reid, saying he'd learned of "evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government 
and Donald Trump's presidential campaign," which had "employed a number of individuals with 
significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin." On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic 
members of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting "that the FBI assess 
whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests" may have contributed 
to the DNC hack so as "to interfere with the U.S. presidential election." On Sept. 23, Yahoo News's 
Michael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier's allegations regarding Carter Page. 
On Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: "In my communications with you and other 
top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive 
information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian 
government." 
That these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump's victory, or that Mr. Comey's ham-fisted 
interventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton's electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal 
significance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials. 
The totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since 
an attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election "shocks the conscience," any 
prosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The public 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026277 
will learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire's genesis. But given 
what is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel's activity be paused. 
Those affected by Mr. Mueller's investigation could litigate such an argument in court. One would 
hope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General Rod 
Rosenstein would do it first.

Mueller's Fruit of the Poisonous Tree 
It makes no difference how honorable he is. His investigation is tainted by the bias that 
attended its origin in 2016. 
By 
David B. Rivkin Jr. and 
Elizabeth Price Foley

Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may face a serious legal obstacle: It is tainted by 
antecedent political bias. The June 14 report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026477 
inspector general, unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking officials at the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. Some of their communications, the report says, were "not only indicative of a 
biased state of mind but imply a willingness to take action to impact a presidential candidate's 
electoral prospects." Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain whether this bias 
"directly affected" specific FBI actions in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, it nonetheless 
affects the legality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. 
Crossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its FBI progenitors—the same ones 
who had investigated Mrs. Clinton—deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign 
advisers, obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wiretap warrants, issued national security 
letters to gather records, and unmasked the identities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They 
also repeatedly leaked investigative information. 
Mr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn't expected to finish for months. But the 
current report reveals that FBI officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald 
Trump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Trump 
investigations, confidently assuaged a colleague's fear that Mr. Trump would become president: "No 
he won't. We'll stop it." An unnamed FBI lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was 
"devastated" and "numb" after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to another FBI attorney: "Viva le 
resistance." 
The report highlights the FBI's failure to act promptly upon discovering that Anthony Weiner's laptop 
contained thousands of Mrs. Clinton's emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the "higher 
priority" of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz writes: "We did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to 
prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on [the] investigative lead discovered on the 
Weiner laptop was free from bias." 
Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey was trying 
to influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the 
inspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was 
motivated by a desire to protect her assumed presidency's legitimacy. 
The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text messages "created the appearance that investigative 
decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations." The report adds, importantly, that "most 
of the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation." Given how biases 
ineluctably shape behavior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton 
investigation and building a narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026478 
I sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton's electoral chances and, if the unthinkable happened, obtain an 
insurance policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of illegitimacy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May 2017 after President Trump 
fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general concludes that the pervasive bias "cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned," including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was 
politically motivated, then its culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All 
special-counsel activities—investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and 
convictions—are fruit of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due process. That Mr. Mueller 
and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin offers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or property, it is required to use fundamentally 
fair processes. The Supreme Court has made clear that when governmental action "shocks the 
conscience," it violates due process. Such conduct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that 
appear, under the totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entrapment. 
In U.S. v. Russell (1973), the justices observed: "We may someday be presented with a situation in 
which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would 
absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction." It didn't take 
long. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), the court concluded that due process was offended by a 
prosecutor's "realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness' " that tainted the "very initiation of proceedings." 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton (1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have "power to 
employ the full machinery of the state in scrutinizing any given individual. . . we must have assurance 
that those who would wield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibility for 
the attainment of justice." Prosecutors must be "disinterested" and make "dispassionate assessments," 
free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias violated due 
process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earlier, in prosecuting the death-row inmate 
whose habeas corpus petition he was hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not 
vitiate the taint but heighten "the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might 
otherwise be obscured," the justices wrote. A single biased individual "might still have an influence 
that, while not so visible . . . is nevertheless significant." 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the inspector general, there is a strong 
circumstantial case—including personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that 
Crossfire was initiated for political, not national-security, purposes. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026479 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department presumption against investigating 
campaigns in an election year. And while impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-
Attorney General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is "particularly important in an election 
year," and "politics must play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investigators regarding 
any investigations. . . . Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of 
investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of 
giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party." 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the case with the bureau's investigation 
of Mrs. Clinton's private email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But 
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence investigation predicated on the 
notion that Russia could be colluding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no 
discernible evidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing 
the notion that it was initiated "for the purpose" of affecting the presidential election. 
The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers. But 
nothing in the public record suggests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative 
therefore hinges on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump's election, and 
that the Trump campaign reciprocated by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive 
surveillance and investigation, there's still no public evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia 
attempted to sow political discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump. 
Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advocated dovish policies. But so did 
numerous American political and academic elites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential 
campaigns routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign powers. The Clinton campaign 
funded the Steele dossier, whose British author paid Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta 
Group, led by the brother of Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for 
Russia's largest bank and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties. 
The Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses. 
No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured 
to London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to 
dinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he'd heard about such dirt but never seen it. These 
circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment. 
The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026480 
Papadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between 
the DNC hack and the Trump campaign. 
Crossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs. 
Clinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If 
anything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by 
dangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it. 
Given the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence 
investigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods 
and subsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump 
associates were Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump 
so that he could protect his campaign and the country. 
Mr. Trump's critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not 
leaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the 
Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire's launch, CIA Director John Brennan and 
Mr. Comey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons 
embarked on a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington. 
On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader 
Harry Reid, saying he'd learned of "evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government 
and Donald Trump's presidential campaign," which had "employed a number of individuals with 
significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin." On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic 
members of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting "that the FBI assess 
whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests" may have contributed 
to the DNC hack so as "to interfere with the U.S. presidential election." On Sept. 23, Yahoo News's 
Michael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier's allegations regarding Carter Page. 
On Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: "In my communications with you and other 
top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive 
information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the 
Russian government." 
That these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump's victory, or that Mr. Comey's ham-fisted 
interventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton's electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal 
significance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026481 
The totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since 
an attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election "shocks the conscience," 
any prosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The 
public will learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire's genesis. 
But given what is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel's activity 
be paused. Those affected by Mr. Mueller's investigation could litigate such an argument in court. 
One would hope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General 
Rod Rosenstein would do it first.

Bannon the European: He's opening the populist fort in Brussels 
The former Trump strategist arrives in Europe with "The Movement". Objective: an alliance between 
right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections 
NEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who was 
Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist 
violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast 
himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of Europe 
and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the European 
elections which will be held in spring 2019. 
Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of the 
Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of 
NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused of 
plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have labour at 
low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior Matteo 
Salvini. 
The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the 
European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and Rome 
— is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great "populist international" of which he has long 
since been dreaming. 
The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic 
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European movements. 
Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling funding. 
The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of "super group" that if victorious can conquer up to a third 
of the European Parliament in the elections next May. 
Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The 
American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress — 
and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen from 
Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. It is not 
a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has already 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019302 
met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of the British 
separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a 
fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the Italians of Lega 
and 5 stars. Of them, he said: "If it works in Italy, we can import the model anywhere". 
The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In 
short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries 
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in the 
future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because the 
relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and published in 
the scandal book "Fire and Fury". "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise," Bannon says now 
paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. Hell in this case would 
be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The "army of darkness" is already among us.

Bannon the European: He's opening the populist fort in Brussels 
The former Trump strategist arrives in Europe with "The Movement". Objective: an alliance between 
right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections 
NEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who 
was Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist 
violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast 
himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of Europe 
and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the European 
elections which will be held in spring 2019. 
Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of 
the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of 
NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused of 
plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have labour at 
low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior Matteo 
Salvini. 
The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the 
European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and Rome 
— is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great "populist international" of which he has long 
since been dreaming. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019305 
The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic 
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European movements. 
Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling funding. 
The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of "super group" that if victorious can conquer up to a 
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May. 
Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The 
American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress — 
and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen from 
Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. It is not 
a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has already 
met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of the British 
separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a 
fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the Italians of Lega 
and 5 stars. Of them, he said: "If it works in Italy, we can import the model anywhere". 
The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In 
short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries 
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in 
the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because 
the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and 
published in the scandal book "Fire and Fury". "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise," 
Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. Hell 
in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The "army of darkness" is already 
among us.

Bannon the European: He's opening the populist fort in Brussels 
The former Trump strategist arrives in Europe with "The Movement". Objective: an alliance 
between right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections 
NEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru 
who was Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following 
the racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the 
Daily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the 
heart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view 
of the European elections which will be held in spring 2019. 
Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor 
of the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in 
support of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist 
right, accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in 
order to have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current 
Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini. 
The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in 
the European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and 
Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great "populist international" of which he 
has long since been dreaming. 
The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic 
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European 
movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling 
funding. 
The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of "super group" that if victorious can conquer up to a 
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May. 
Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The 
American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress 
— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data 
stolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump 
emerged victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019322 
West. And he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and 
the former leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on 
Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. 
Without forgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: "If it works in Italy, we can 
import the model anywhere". 
The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. 
In short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries 
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But 
in the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also 
because the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff 
and published in the scandal book "Fire and Fury". "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in 
Paradise," Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost 
Paradise. Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The "army of 
darkness" is already among us.

Bannon the European: He's opening the populist fort in Brussels 
The former Trump strategist arrives in Europe with "The Movement". Objective: an alliance between 
right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections 
NEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who 
was Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist 
violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast 
himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019348 
Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the 
European elections which will be held in spring 2019. 
Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of 
the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of 
NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused 
of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have 
labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior 
Matteo Salvini. 
The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the 
European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and 
Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great "populist international" of which he 
has long since been dreaming. 
The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic 
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European 
movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling 
funding. 
The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of "super group" that if victorious can conquer up to a 
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May. 
Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The 
American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress 
— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen 
from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. 
It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has 
already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of 
the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, 
USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the 
Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: "If it works in Italy, we can import the model 
anywhere". 
The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In 
short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries 
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in 
the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because 
the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and 
published in the scandal book "Fire and Fury". "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise," 
Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. 
Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The "army of darkness" is 
already among us.

In recent weeks, prosecutors with the Justice Department's public integrity section — which examines possible 
political and government corruption — have sought documents related to Broidy's business dealings. 
Among the information sought by investigators are details about Broidy's work on behalf of and interactions 
with the Chinese and Malaysian officials, according to two people familiar with the document requests. 
As part of their efforts, prosecutors have subpoenaed casino magnate Steve Wynn, the former RNC finance 
chairman and longtime Trump friend, for copies of records and communications related to Broidy. 
An attorney for Wynn, Reid Weingarten, declined to comment, saying only that Wynn is cooperating with the 
Justice Department. 
"Steve Wynn is completely cooperating with the investigation and he certainly has no reason to believe that 
anyone acted improperly in anything he knew about or was involved in," Weingarten said in a statement.

Alex Acosta update 
Earlier this week, pedophile Jeffrey Epstein bought his way out of a lawsuit that would have 
given some of his victims the opportunity to testify about his predatory and criminal 
conduct. Victims never got that opportunity when Epstein faced criminal charges, because 
Alex Acosta___then the lead prosecutor, now the Secretary of Labor___let Epstein off with 
a ridiculously lenient sentence. Despite having committed hideous sex offenses with dozens 
of minors, Epstein received a sentence of 13 months in jail, during which he was often free 
during the day. 
Epstein's decision to buy his out of the civil lawsuit, one that he had the nerve to initiate, 
benefits Acosta. The trial would have provided non-stop headlines, coupled with frequent 
references to the sweetheart deal Acosta gave him. As Randy Schultz puts it, the trial would 
have been the occasion for a long overdue public shaming of Acosta. Now, he avoids this 
consequence. 
But this doesn't mean Acosta is out of the woods. He faces calls for his ouster from the 
Trump cabinet. 
Some calls are from the usual suspects. Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times has 
written a piece so obnoxious that it almost makes me want to see Acosta ride out the storm. 
But some conservatives are also advocating Acosta's departure. Concerned Women for 
America is a stalwart conservative organization. It describes itself, accurately, as "focus[ed] 
on seven core issues: the family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education, 
sexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel." (Emphasis added) 
> 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030983 
Its leader, Penny Nance, has called for Acosta's resignation. Noting that labor trafficking, 
which the Labor Department combats, is often conjoined with sex trafficking, Nance says 
that President Trump would not have nominated Acosta if reports fully describing Acosta's 
conduct in the Epstein case had emerged earlier. 
Sen. Ben Sasse has also weighed in. He sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to 
investigate its treatment of Epstein, including the fact that the plea deal ensured that victims 
of the pervert would be denied the ability to comment on or object to the leniency of his 
sentence. Sasse is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight, 
Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts. 
Sen. Marco Rubio, a longtime supporter of Acosta, says it would be "very troubling" if 
political influence led to a light sentence for Epstein. In Rubio's view, and that of every 
rational person, Epstein "should have been in jail for a long time." Rubio added, however, 
that he will reserve judgment until he hears Acosta's side. 
That's fair. But so far, Acosta has provided no real defense for letting Epstein off so lightly. 
In public, at least, he is standing by his argument that the deal was a reasonable one and that 
this is old news. 
Previously, Acosta had a different defense. He cited "a year-long assault on the prosecution 
and the prosecutors" by "an army of legal superstars" who represented Epstein. This 
allegedly included "defense counsel investigat[ing] individual prosecutors and their families, 
looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification." In this 
account, the deal was made to relieve the pressure, while still getting a conviction. 
Acosta could hardly assert this explanation____i.e., that he wimped out___while seeking a 
cabinet position with the expectation of being appointed to more exalted jobs in the future. 
Nor is the explanation particularly plausible. Acosta isn't the first prosecutor to face a 
scorched earth defense. Ask Ken Starr about this. 
I don't doubt that Acosta regarded escaping the wrath of the defense team as a benefit of 
reaching the plea deal. But I don't believe this was incentive enough to cause him, in effect, 
to throw the case. 
What was the true incentive? As I wrote when this story broke, I think it was the same 
incentive that explains much of his conduct in public life___Acosta's desire to accommodate 
people he thinks can help him down the road. 
Which people? Probably the lawyers at Kirkland and Ellis, where Acosta had once worked. 
Epstein enlisted Ken Starr* and Jay Lefkowitz, both of Kirkland, for his defense team. 
Acosta reportedly worked out the terms of his surrender with Lefkowitz, a former colleague, 
at a meeting in a location far away from the prosecutor's office. 
The location of the meeting is itself suspicious. Prosecutors and other law enforcement 
officials normally demand that those seeking a deal come to them. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030984 
The fact that Acosta didn't is another sign___if one were needed___that this was a 
capitulation. It also casts further doubt on the claim that Acosta was capitulating for the 
purpose of sparing the folks who worked with him in the prosecutor's office. 
The key point, though, is that Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz were power players in 
Washington___men who might help Acosta down the road. 
Readers will be quite familiar with Starr's background. Lefkowitz was director of cabinet 
affairs and deputy executive secretary to the domestic policy council under President George 
H.W. Bush. Under President George W. Bush, Lefkowitz served as general counsel in the 
Office of Management and Budget and later as deputy director of domestic policy at the 
White House. 
Accommodating such influential figures must have seemed like a good career move. Having 
Starr and Lefkowitz on his side might help Acosta get a judgeship, a cabinet appointment, or 
a high-paying job back at Kirkland and Ellis. 
I'm speculating, of course. But my speculation finds support in Acosta's practice of 
accommodating the powerful. 
Much of that accommodation is of Democrats. Indeed, at the time Acosta was working in 
Miami as a U.S. Attorney, he had alienated some Republicans by such accommodation  
while at the Department of Justice. Some say he was on the verge of being fired when 
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez parachuted him to Miami. The Epstein settlement was a 
way for Acosta to shore up his standing with some influential Republicans. 
Will Acosta be able to survive the current scandal? I don't have a clear sense about this yet. 
But President Trump, who isn't bashful about sacking cabinet members, may come to 
believe (if he doesn't now) that it's disadvantageous to have a cabinet member who sold out 
teenage victims of sexual abuse, especially when the sell-out benefited an ultra-wealthy 
serial offender. 
* Some on the left are trying to make something or the fact that Starr, who had investigated 
Bill Clinton in connection with sexual misconduct, later defended Epstein, a pervert. This is 
silly. 
In both instances, Starr was doing his job as a lawyer. Perverts are entitled to a defense and 
there is nothing hypocritical about investigating Bill Clinton's misconduct when that was 
Starr's job and later joining the team that was defending Jeffrey Epstein. 
Acosta, by contrast, was on the team seeking justice for Epstein and for his victims. He gave 
up this quest for reasons that can't be defended.

One unusual thing about Powell's appointment is that he is a lawyer, not an economist. From Yellen going back 
to Alan Greenspan, who started as chair in 1987, all Fed chairs have held a Ph.D. in economics. Alan Blinder, 
an economist at Princeton, has said that a doctorate has become more or less a prerequisite of the job—without 
one, he told Harvard Business Review, "the Fed's staff will run technical rings around you." While that remains 
to be seen, it is true that there are over 300 Ph.D. economists on the Fed's staff, and Powell could end up 
needing to lean on their expertise more than a Fed chair with a doctorate in economics might.

Jeffrey....how much do you know about this? 
When can I call you tomorrow? I know nothing but have friends at Netflix. 
Eleanora Kennedy called me today....out of the blue...and told me the film makers wanted to talk to me. I 
know director Joe Berlinger, not well, but may have done a screening on one of his films. Would have to 
check. 
I am around all day tomorrow.

Dear Peggy, 
My good friend Eleanore reached out to you on my behalf and I appreciate you wanting to hear 
more about this project. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017827 
I am a TV journalist who covered the Epstein story for several years and wrote a best selling book 
about him with James Patterson in 2016. 
Jim Patterson and I are now consulting on a four hour Netflix documentary series tentatively set to 
air towards the end of the year. 
The showrunner, Lisa Bryant, is working with director Joe Berlinger whose work I am sure you are 
familiar with, to produce a fair and balanced, in-depth recounting of the Epstein saga that, as you 
know, has every possible dramatic angle and is a story like no other. 
We thought of you because of your remarkable reputation in the public relations and show business 
world and the fact that you were an acquaintance of Jeffrey Epstein. 
The tawdry side of the story has been told...We hope you can give us some insight and context into 
who he was before his life fell apart. 
I am sure that Lisa Bryant,Joe Berlinger and Jim Patterson would all make themselves available to 
get on a call with you this week. 
Jim is in Florida,and Joe is traveling overseas for his Ted Bundy film. 
Lisa is in New York and would be happy to meet you in person as would I. 
Thanks for giving this your consideration. 
Best, 
Tim Malloy
