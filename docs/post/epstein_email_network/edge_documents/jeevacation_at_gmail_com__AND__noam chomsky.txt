Very interesting topics. Would like to hear more from you about them, when we have a chance. Is it worldwide, or 
mostly here? 
My impression is that the fear is mostly in the US. There's nothing in (much more vulnerable) Europe comparable to the 
Visa Waiver program (insanely targeting Iran, which has not been involved in terrorism, while exempting Saudi Arabia, 
the source of almost all jihadi terrorism). Or Trump-style ban them all. Or Cruz-style carpet-bomb them. For a long 
time, probably back to colonial days, this has been a very frightened country, maybe the safest in the world but also the 
most frightened. Impressions. 
Sometimes it's quite weird. By accident, I took the first flight PanAm 103 after the Lockerbie bombing, together with an 
old friend, a veteran Middle East correspondent. It must have been the safest flight in human history. The plane was 
empty. We were bumped up to first class because there was no one there.

induced fear is driving world markets. . very odd. gas prices down nobody shopping, . hotel prices down less 
travel, commodity prices way down, little building. luxury market decimated. no russians or chinese

This is the program David Marr initiated, developed by Shimon Ullman and others. Makes sense, and there are some 
interesting results. David was a friend, and we often discussed these topics. In fact, his famous three levels adapted a 
model from generative grammar. But there was always the fundamental problem I mentioned. Vision is an input 
system, crafting coherent images from lines, points of light, etc. Language is used for that purpose too, but it's not 
what language is. 
That fundamental difference, along with the fact that the principles involved seem quite different, has always been a 
stumbling block to seeking any link.

We don't teach children language either, contrary to many beliefs. The visual grammar just grows, and as is known, 
can develop in various ways depending on early experience. Same with the language grammar, though the period in 
which experience has a shaping effect is much longer. 
However, there are fundamental differences between vision and language. Can send you a recent paper about it if 
you like. Vision is an input system. Language isn't. It's an internal capacity, a system of knowledge, which is used to 
process input and also to produce thoughts (sometimes externalized). Seems also to be modality independent. And 
their properties look wholly different, so it's hard to see how one could piggy-back on the other.

I read what his ghost-writer said about him. Pretty scary. 
Reminds me of something I was told by Jon Snow, one of England's most sensible newsmen. He was with the 
press entourage accompanying Tony Blair on his visit to Saudi Arabia, and walking around one of the palaces 
one day, he saw Blair sitting in a room with a book in his lap, which greatly surprised him -- until he came over 
to talk. It was the New Testament. 
And then Blair started telling about how delighted he and Cheri were with the gold door handles,.... 
I notice that your prediction was right about Trump's avoiding the White House as far too primitive. Must be 
driving the Secret Service up the wall. 
I'll keep in mind what you say about Trump's tweets, but they are hard to ignore. Whatever he may think, 
others here and abroad can't help considering the meaning of the words, and take action accordingly. 
About meaning, It's not clear to me how to distinguish the meaning of "New York" (however it is correctly 
specified) from the concept. Still don't see how to work out field models.
