RELATIONSHIP:
Etienne Binant and Jeffrey Epstein communicate in a collaborative, business-oriented manner about coordinating art acquisitions, with Epstein responding briefly and Binant providing detailed clarification and planning.

KEY TOPICS:
Clarifying the intended strategy for acquiring artwork—focusing on visiting artists’ studios, fostering personal connections, and supporting emerging talent rather than attending art fairs.
Scheduling discussions and planning travel to meet artists in cities such as Los Angeles or Berlin.
Epstein noting recent delays due to being busy during the Trump political period.

NOTABLE:
Binant emphasizes a philanthropic-sounding goal of influencing the art ecosystem by directly backing young, financially vulnerable artists.
