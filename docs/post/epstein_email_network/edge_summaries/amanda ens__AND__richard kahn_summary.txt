RELATIONSHIP:
Amanda Ens, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch equities director, regularly emails Richard Kahn investment research, trade recommendations, and meeting invitations, with no recorded replies, reflecting a one-sided professional advisory relationship.

KEY TOPICS:
Post-Trump-election market strategy, including equity volatility, rising interest rates, Japan bullishness, and the reflation trade.
Specific trading ideas such as SPX puts, DXJ call spreads, XLF call spreads, and European bank equities, supported by macro and sector analysis.
Invitations to analyst and commodities briefings featuring senior BofA research leadership.

NOTABLE:
Kahn’s lack of response suggests he may be a distribution-list recipient rather than an active client participant.
