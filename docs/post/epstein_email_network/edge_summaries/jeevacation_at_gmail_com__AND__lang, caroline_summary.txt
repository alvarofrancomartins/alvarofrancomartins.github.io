RELATIONSHIP:
Jeffrey Epstein and Caroline Lang exchange brief, friendly messages centered on social coordination with her father (Jack Lang) and light political commentary, indicating an informal, acquaintance-level relationship. 

KEY TOPICS:
Arranging meetings in Paris, including attending the Hergé/Tintin exhibition at the Grand Palais and coordinating whether Epstein’s assistants could join. 
Caroline updating Epstein on her father’s health and mood, noting he was tired and depressed by the U.S. presidential campaign. 
Political commentary about Trump, including Epstein joking that Jack Lang should move to the U.S. and repeating his prediction that investigators would “go after [Trump’s] family first.” 

NOTABLE:
Despite being a minimal thread, the exchange shows Epstein engaging comfortably with the Lang family on both cultural outings and real-time political predictions.
