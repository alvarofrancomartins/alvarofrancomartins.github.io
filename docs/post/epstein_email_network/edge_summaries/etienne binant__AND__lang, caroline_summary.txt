RELATIONSHIP:
Etienne Binant and Caroline Lang exchange brief updates while jointly coordinating with Jeffrey Epstein on planned art acquisitions, reflecting a cooperative, business-oriented communication pattern.

KEY TOPICS:
Aligning on an art-buying strategy focused on visiting artists’ studios, cultivating direct relationships, and supporting emerging artists rather than attending art fairs.
Scheduling discussions and clarifying travel plans to meet artists in locations such as Los Angeles or Berlin.
Epstein indicating delays due to being “crazy busy” during the political climate surrounding Trump.

NOTABLE:
Both Binant and Lang emphasize a mission-driven approach of influencing the art ecosystem by backing young, under-recognized artists through personal engagement.
