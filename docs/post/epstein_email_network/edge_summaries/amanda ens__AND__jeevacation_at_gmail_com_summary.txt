KEY TOPICS:
Post-2016 U.S. election market strategy, including volatility, interest rates, Japan equities, U.S. financials, and reflation-driven investment opportunities.
Specific trade recommendations—SPX puts, DXJ call spreads, XLF call spreads, and S&P hedges—supported by research, positioning commentary, and macroeconomic forecasts.
Invitations to analyst briefings and commodity policy discussions involving senior Bank of America strategists.

NOTABLE:
